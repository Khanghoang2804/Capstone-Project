He has had a variety of jobs in the photographic industry ranging from motion picture lab technician to portraits & weddings to commercial studio work to medical photography lab technician to newspaper photographer and most recently shooting virtual tours and panoramic images. John first started teaching, actually the unofficial teaching assistant, at the School of Modern Photography in Montreal back in the early 70's when he himself was still a student. The lead instructor recognized John's ability to explain photographic principals and lighting techniques to other students and asked him to participate as the unofficial teaching assistant.

His father was a leader for decades in Johannesburg, South Africa, and a well-known icon in the industry. Colin was soon headhunted to lead the art departments of the top commercial and industrial printing companies in Johannesburg and started his own repro and bureau company, offering his pre-press services to many screen printers in Joburg for over 20 years, as well as offering his skills in the form of training to the top screen-printers in South Africa like Hightide and Amrod, as well as printers in Mauritius. Colin thrived in a world where techniques were closing trade secrets by developing his own methods and perfecting the ones that are in the public domain, as well as developing apps that automate some of the processes. Today, at almost 50 years old, he is a best-selling graphic novel author and artist on Amazon, offering his services in website development, graphic design, and 3D design. He is also still active in offering his sought-after colour separations remotely to a handful of screen printers when they need the impossible jobs made possible, and he is still actively consulting and training the art locally for the next generation of screen printing leaders in South Africa, giving hands-on training to staff and individuals onsite and remotely, while still improvising on the methods and processes constantly.

I love to paint with Watercolors and Acrylics. And I also love to explore Gouache, Charcoal, Oil pastels and mixed media too.  Since I haven’t been to an art school and have learned through practice and observation, I find it difficult to confine myself to a particular medium. I love to work on different subjects and different styles constantly. It helps me keep learning and maintain newness in my work. I started with Acrylics as they are so forgiving and very-very user-friendly. And I used to be scared of Watercolors in the beginning but once I gave it a try, I instantly fell in love with the medium. Its so fresh, transparent, and most importantly it has the mind of its own. No matter how much you try but you cant completely control it’s own unique magic.My favorite things to paint are Landscapes and illustrative characters and scene. I also like the cute and fun doodles. Here I will take you through the basics techniques of Watercolors and Acrylics along with fun projects of Mixed media, Clay murals, Glass Painting and Folk.

I've turned thousands of people into user experience designers and researchers and now you can join their ranks by taking my courses on Udemy.    You're probably curious about my background. At 18, I appeared as an extra in the film “Quadrophenia"" alongside Sting and Ray Winstone. Despite a critically-acclaimed performance lasting 5 seconds, follow-up offers from Hollywood failed to arrive so I turned to psychology where I gained a BSc and a PhD. Since 1989 I've worked in the fields of human factors, usability and user experience and I've published three books on usability, including ""Think Like a UX Researcher"". I'm now a User Experience Strategist at Userfocus, a consultancy specialising in user experience. I'm no longer in contact with Sting or Ray Winstone, whose career trajectories have been somewhat different.  I've provided usability support to top brands like HP, Microsoft, Whirlpool, Orange, Skype, eBay and Yahoo! and I've also consulted with public sector organisations like The Greater London Authority, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, UK Government and the World Health Organization.  My students describe me as passionate and technically knowledgeable and students voted me an ""Outstanding Instructor"" in a Udemy-wide survey .Hiện thêmẨn bớt",61%,30%,8%,1%,< 1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 7/2023,999.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế trải nghiệm người dùng,Thiết kế trải nghiệm người dùng (UX),12 phần,154 bài giảng,12 giờ 1 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-guide-to-ux/

And now, you can learn from me as well!Get started by enrolling in my courses, learning new skills and knowledge, and asking me questions in the courses and forums.My Three-Part Qualifications to Teach You (Professional Experience, Education, and Experience Teaching):By combining my professional in-the-field experience (both full-time and freelance), formal education, and experience teaching these topics, I've been able to produce top-notch courses that maximize learning and enable students to become better graphic designers, logo designers, photo editors, artists, and digital media producers.Real World, Professional Experience:I've worked as Webmaster and Advertising Designer at a regional newspaper (The News Chief), Internet Development Director at an award-winning advertising design firm, Technology Librarian at a city library system, and Managing Editor at two international graphic design magazines at Kelby Media Group.

My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on the mythic branding of Apple's Macintosh/Mac in their primary commercial campaigns (1984, Think Different, Switch/Real People, and Get a Mac). Example graduate courses such as Creative Approaches to Digital Media and Visual Storytelling have helped me when developing my own courses. Experience Teaching:Teaching these topics in the classroom and online has helped me figure out the best ways to explain concepts and guide students in the designs and productions.

Major kudos to you for taking the steps to become the person who can make that change happen.As part of the team of Udemy instructors, I work on courses to help you level-up as a professional User Experience (UX) designer.I’m on a mission to create...- entertaining learning that you sail through,- courses that deliver rock-solid strategies and top-tier techniques, and- how-tos that are specific, actionable, and brimming with real-world examples.But ultimately… I’m on a mission to turn YOU into an epic UX Designer.From the trenches:I work to improve the usability, accessibility, and overall glamour of websites, apps, and software. And I do this for a living. My job is to make outdated, ugly, usability messes into seamlessly flowing, delightful, user-friendly beauties. This has been my UX journey.For many years I worked as a senior UX designer for a U.S. government contractor. My job was to use “UX magic” to craft beautiful, inclusively-designed, high-performing web applications for various military branches (e.g. Army, Air Force, Marines, Dept of Homeland Security, Dept of Defense, Centers for Disease Control). My team’s “magic tricks” worked. We brought UX to gov agencies that had never heard of it before. UX believers were born.My UX journey has been full of lessons learned the hard way, real-world on-the-job challenges, and demanding boots-on-the-ground work. But also exciting experiences pitching innovation ideas to executives who were leagues above my rank, winning innovation awards & funding, and working with incredible teams of powerhouses on multi-million dollar projects that impacted millions of users.What I love about UX is that it never stops developing; as I too am a lifelong student of UX. I believe in the mantra, ""To become an expert, you must remain a student”.I’m working to create courses that will level-up your expertise across the UX spectrum.The repertoire I’d like to pass to you:Iterative UX Research –- UX strategy- Lean UX, Agile UX- User & business needs assessment- User research & usability testing- Compiling & communicating findings to decision-makers- Pitching UX ideas, innovation ideas, or just UX in generalIterative UX & UI Design –- Information architectures- Wireframes (sketches and digital)- Mockups (visual UI design, storytelling, branding)- Designing for accessibility (WCAG, Section 508, ADA, and others)- Prototyping, responsive design, interaction design- Living design systems / style guides- Writing for the web- Designer & developer collaborationWhich topic(s) would you like me to put at the top of my list to create a course about?What’s different about my courses:1. We redesign existing UIs together so you can see how to do it (I believe in showing not just telling).2. Many “Ah-ha” moments — We look at existing designs, identify their problems, then you watch as we transform the designs using our best practices.3. Extremely practical and specific — No high-level generalizations, or “it depends”, or plain theory.4. Did I mention real-world examples? Yes, practical, from-the-field tricks.5. Learn from real stories — Nothing sticks to the human brain better than stories. (Yay psychology!)6. Each section ends with an “action summary” (a summary + checklist of action items) — It’s what I do to make my courses really actionable.7. Get ready to be encouraged and uplifted the entire way — These courses are all about YOU and transforming you into the stand-out designer you’re destined to be.How students describe me: “The passion of the instructor is contagious, the examples are on point and the explanations are great. I will definitely recommend this to my colleagues, thank you Liz” —Student, How to Design For Accessibility courseBe proud of yourself for exploring courses; you are taking concrete steps to level-up your expertise, broaden your skillset, and load up your toolbox.

Starting out in more traditional mediums I cut my teeth in pencil, charcoal, and acrylic painting until discovering tattooing. This began a love affair with art and lead me to open 7th seasons studios. Nothing inspires a higher level of perfection than knowing the client will walk around with my art for the rest of their lives. After completing a masters in business and having to manage the marketing of a successful shop I quickly realized that the future of art is digital and I began making my own show banners and managing my own website. This sealed the deal and digital art has replaced the traditional pen an ink for me. Furthermore the industry has changed to such a degree that more and more clients and artists are demanding digital skills i the design and application of art, and so I saw a significantly under served market in people with existing talent, but lacking digital As a career teacher the most rewarding portion of what i do is seeing someone learn what they previously thought what out of reach and gain a confidence through the learning process....I identify with that because i m a firm believer in the beginner mindset and the idea of a life long learner. To me, art is as essential as breathing and I cannot even narrow down all the ways I express myself through various mediums, that is one of the best competitive advantages I feel we have at 7th season.....we are constantly curious. I believe every person has within them a desire to create something out of life....and many times they lack the skills to realize this. 7th season studios is about taking this need and in reality changing ""I wish""....to ""I am glad I did"". Teaching allows us to do that, sometimes it is teaching engineering, sometimes writing, and sometimes digital art and film production We primarily work with small businesses and solo entrepreneurs with no staff and no budget showing them how to make the most of their valuable time to deliver their vision for their business to the clients they serve...this is why our training catalog has such a wide variety of offerings in terms of platforms and skills......because these are the skills we wish we had when we started 7th season. Feel free to reach out using the Q&A if there are issues or questions on the courses I post Hiện thêmẨn bớt",59%,31%,7%,2%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 4/2024,449.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Công cụ thiết kế,Affinity Designer,24 phần,221 bài giảng,23 giờ 27 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/affinity-designer-the-complete-guide-to-affinity-designer/

I graduated from Humboldt State University amid the redwoods of Northern California. After working for Lockheed Missiles and Space for 14 years as an IBM system programmer and Cisco Systems for 12 years as a test engineer, I retired at 48.I instantly became bored.2 Community CollegeIn response to my boredom, I enrolled in Columbia Community College to take writing, art, acting, and statistics classes. I took 24 units over one year and received straight A's.I was still bored.3 Writing and Self-publishingI began writing fiction and nonfiction books and self-publishing them on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Smashwords in July 2011. Though I wrote and published several books, my self-publishing business didn’t take off until my wife joined me.4 My Wife and Author, Melanie JacksonMy wife, Melanie Jackson, was an author who published over two romance novels per year through her New York publisher, Dorchester Press. After publishing 24 novels with Dorchester, the company folded, and Melanie was without a publisher (she wanted to write cozy mysteries anyway).I convinced Melanie to join me in self-publishing cozy mysteries on Amazon.5 The Self-publishing YearsFor the last 14 years, from July 2011 until now (2/15/2025), my wife and I have written and self-published cozy mysteries. At first, we continued to self-publish on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Smashwords, but eventually chose to self-publish exclusively on Amazon. I've self-published well over 100 of my wife’s books on Amazon.During the last 14 years, from 2011 until now (2/15/2025), my wife and I have made precisely $501,711.89 self-publishing books on Amazon alone.6 My Wife and IWhen I say “my wife and I,” I mean that my wife did the writing, and I helped with the brainstorming, did half the editing, created the book covers, and self-published and marketed my wife’s books. So, my wife had it pretty good while I honed my writing, self-publishing and marketing skills.After about five years of self-publishing a book every two months, Melanie and I burned out and slowed way, waaayyy, doowwwnnn…7 UdemyI began publishing courses on Udemy, Skillshare and multiple other sites in July 2014, focusing on writing, self-publishing and book covers.

I was an art educator for 30 years, teaching graphic design, fine art, and theatrical design. My own education took place at college and university, in Manitoba, Canada, and has been honed through decades of graphic design experience and my work as a professional artist, which I have done for over 40 years (eeek!). In the last few years I have also been involved in art licensing with contracts from Russ, Artwall, Studio El, Trends, Metaverse and more.This is where I say something existential or clever about my inspiration: The colours of nature and my intuition guide my art: my most generous muses are light, sunshine, and flora. My work ranges through multiple media: my confidence with acrylic paint, ink, marker, collage, pencil, pastels, pencil crayon, watercolour, and digital painting provide many ready paths of self-expression.But to be honest, often I don’t plan how a piece will ultimately look, but work in many layers, creating new relationships and deepening the complexity, intricacy and subtlety of the images over time. Once complete, I use this art for greeting cards, wall art and many other pieces I sell though art licensing and on products I create for my store. The bottom line? I love to experiment and mix both natural and digital mediums to create everything from very commercial work to very non-commercial fine art abstract paintings (and yes, I do sell these, so I guess they are commercial after all).I am so excited to share my knowledge with you all in the Udemy universe as this has been one of my favourite haunts.

Nowadays, we tend to take pictures in order to remember all that. The digital photos imply realism – you see the world as it is. But beauty is only skin deep. You are not able to see the metaphysics of the moment looking at the pictures.In my watercolor paintings, I always give a sense of the current state of human souls, models’ doubts, anxieties, joy, and sorrow, what actually hides behind the smiles. In classic portraits, you can see the eyes of people. I set a more challenging goal as follows: not showing models’ eyes and faces, to depict the immediate emotional state, the current state of the model’s soul through the pose, chemistry between the photographer and the model.Also, I draw cats. They are my favorite animals.

Once I do that, I would want to know how to analyze performance of my design and I would have gone for STA-1, STA-2  and Timing ECO webinar courses, respectivelyOnce you STA, there’s an internal curiosity which rises, and wants us to understand, what goes inside timing analysis at transistor level. To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts. So for that, I would start to learn TCL-Part1 and TCL-Part2 courses, at very beginning or in middleFinally, if I want to learn RTL and synthesis, from specifications to layout, RISC-V ISA course will teach the best way to define specs for a complex system like microprocessor Connect with me for more guidance !!   Hope you enjoy the session best of luck for future Kunal

I'm Ferdy Korpershoek, and I come from the charming city of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I first saw the light of day in 1986 and spent my childhood in the lovely town of Maassluis, not far from my birthplace. As far back as I can remember, I've always had a slew of hobbies and interests that kept me busy. Playing soccer, strumming on the guitar and piano, and dabbling in singing were just a few of the passions that filled my days. Yet, with so many things I loved to do, it was often a challenge to allocate my attention effectively.As the years passed, I delved into the realms of Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Dreamweaver, Joomla, and WordPress. It was during this time that I confronted a familiar dilemma; my wide range of interests prevented me from truly excelling in any single pursuit. I found myself bouncing from one hobby to the next and back again, struggling to focus.A few years ago, I made a pivotal decision to narrow my focus. Photography, Videography, web design, and teaching became my top priorities, to the extent that I transformed my passion into a profession. These are the areas where I'm determined to shine.Since 2014, I've been running my own business, where I immerse myself in videography, photography, and web design. On top of that, I have the pleasure of contributing to WordPressKing, which is more than just a job – it's one of my greatest passions.

I was an art educator for 30 years, teaching graphic design, fine art, and theatrical design. My own education took place at college and university, in Manitoba, Canada, and has been honed through decades of graphic design experience and my work as a professional artist, which I have done for over 40 years (eeek!). In the last few years I have also been involved in art licensing with contracts from Russ, Artwall, Studio El, Trends, Metaverse and more.This is where I say something existential or clever about my inspiration: The colours of nature and my intuition guide my art: my most generous muses are light, sunshine, and flora. My work ranges through multiple media: my confidence with acrylic paint, ink, marker, collage, pencil, pastels, pencil crayon, watercolour, and digital painting provide many ready paths of self-expression.But to be honest, often I don’t plan how a piece will ultimately look, but work in many layers, creating new relationships and deepening the complexity, intricacy and subtlety of the images over time. Once complete, I use this art for greeting cards, wall art and many other pieces I sell though art licensing and on products I create for my store. The bottom line? I love to experiment and mix both natural and digital mediums to create everything from very commercial work to very non-commercial fine art abstract paintings (and yes, I do sell these, so I guess they are commercial after all).I am so excited to share my knowledge with you all in the Udemy universe as this has been one of my favourite haunts. I feel privileged and excited to become an online teacher here amongst some real stars in the art world. Please join me in my classes and follow me.

Professor Brick Maker - PBM) and I’ve always had a deep love of miniatures and designing and building with Lego bricks.  My Lego renaissance happened when I received the original Forest Hideout as a birthday gift.  Years later I saw the movie “Toy Story” and again my mind was blown.  I had to know how to animate characters like the ones I saw in that incredible movie, so I left my family business and began researching animation schools in Northern California.I studied Character Animation at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and got a job with an awesome game studio called Munkyfun.  While working as an animator I began a company called Brick Brigade, prototyping and kitting Lego military models to sell online and at conventions.  At my very first convention in 2010 called Bricks by the Bay in Fremont, I made great friends, sold a bunch of kits and met Dan from Brickmania.After having great success with Brick Brigade, in 2017 I decided to join forces with Brickmania and went to work with Dan and his awesome crew in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I contributed my abilities to the success of Brickmania and over the years have designed and prototyped lots of building kits for the company.  I was known for adding a bit of whimsy to the kits that I designed and some on-screen silliness during the taping of the Brickmania's ""at the designers desk"" videos.  After about two and a half years working for Brickmania at their headquarters in Minnesota, I returned to California and continued to design prototypes for the company.  I also attended several Lego fan conventions and other Lego related events as their representative, promoting Brickmania and their stores.  While attending Lego events, I was often asked, “How do I get started making Lego Prototypes?”.  So I began creating these courses for Lego model building fans. Those that want to take their designs to the next level.  While most of prototyping involves one’s individual vision, there is some very useful information and techniques I’ve gathered along my journey that I look forward to sharing with all of you.My hope is by sharing my knowledge, I can help inspire you to build more precise, historically accurate and awesome minifig scale models made from the bricks we love.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 6/2023,1.199.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế khác,Làm đồ thủ công,9 phần,29 bài giảng,4 giờ 10 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/building-tanks-with-lego-bricks/

I was an art educator for 30 years, teaching graphic design, fine art, and theatrical design. My own education took place at college and university, in Manitoba, Canada, and has been honed through decades of graphic design experience and my work as a professional artist, which I have done for over 40 years (eeek!). In the last few years I have also been involved in art licensing with contracts from Russ, Artwall, Studio El, Trends, Metaverse and more.This is where I say something existential or clever about my inspiration: The colours of nature and my intuition guide my art: my most generous muses are light, sunshine, and flora. My work ranges through multiple media: my confidence with acrylic paint, ink, marker, collage, pencil, pastels, pencil crayon, watercolour, and digital painting provide many ready paths of self-expression.But to be honest, often I don’t plan how a piece will ultimately look, but work in many layers, creating new relationships and deepening the complexity, intricacy and subtlety of the images over time. Once complete, I use this art for greeting cards, wall art and many other pieces I sell though art licensing and on products I create for my store. The bottom line? I love to experiment and mix both natural and digital mediums to create everything from very commercial work to very non-commercial fine art abstract paintings (and yes, I do sell these, so I guess they are commercial after all).I am so excited to share my knowledge with you all in the Udemy universe as this has been one of my favourite haunts. I feel privileged and excited to become an online teacher here amongst some real stars in the art world. Please join me in my classes and follow me.

Their greatest untapped resource is their own light.My expertise - and mission, has since been centered on how to help others shine their light daily and practically, and how you can create real lasting transformation from inside out.Having trained as a certified life coach and practitioner of Neurolinguistics Programming, I began to challenge current thinking at the time.This led me on a quest to find how to integrate technology into my work. First, I discovered Neuroscience, the science of the brain, and the fascination led me to study different offshoots of Neuroscience, including Neurotheology, Neurofinance, Behavioral Economics and Neuromarketing. I have gone on to become a practitioner of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Hypnotherapy, and Family Systems Engineering,Having been introduced to my first computer in my father’s house in 2002, I have been a big enthusiast and user of technology. As a born teacher-trainer, an Industrial Designer (graphic design major) turned behavioral change professional, product designer, and author of the groundbreaking book, Limitless Courage & Confidence: Evidence-Based Strategies For Overcoming Fear And Living Free From Anxiety, Dayo Samuel is the creator and leading authority on The Fear Resolve Process which helps busy professionals clear the mental and emotional blocks that are keeping them stuck, or feeling overwhelmed. I developed this process so that business professionals can conquer fear, manage stress, transform anger, quell worry and anxiety, and build the personal power to face life’s challenges with unstoppable confidence.In 2014, I founded Audacity2Lead, the company that helps coaches, consultants and course creators design and build systems, strategies and structures for the growth of their business. The company was famous for helping over 1000 brands and businesses create and launch successful online platforms and podcasts.Today, I perfectly bridge the gap between coaching, training, and transformative technology. This is evident in my work at The Dayo Samuel Research Multiversity (DSRM), a new forward-thinking research first translating science into everyday tools of transformation, wealth and wellbeing, and utilizing emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality Therapy, Biotech, Emotion AI, Behavioral Change, and Neurofeedback to create deep and lasting human transformations.As a former counsellor, I volunteered with Mentally Aware Nigeria (MANI) and The Alright’s Passion Counselors Network where I took on regular client cases.As a business consultant, I serve as the lead consultant at Audacity2Lead overseeing the team of professionals in creating real business results for clients.Dayo continues to assist his clients with designing personalized, effective ways to transform habits, behaviours, processes, and systems in order to enable adaptive and sustained solutions via his books, programs, podcasts, social media and YouTube channel.Dayo is deeply committed to personal resourcefulness and helping others transform their lives, and their world.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 6/2024,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế & Minh họa đồ họa,Canva,5 phần,10 bài giảng,1 giờ 15 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/diy-business-logo-design-canva/

195,Byzantine Iconography Painting Series 1: Painting Basics (3),Introduction to Painting Byzantine Icons,N/A,"Xếp hạng: 5,0/55,0 (6 xếp hạng)69 học viên","Bridget HayesByzantine Iconographer4,9 xếp hạng giảng viên816 đánh giá1114 học viên20 khóa họcHello, I'm Julia. I'm a South African born byzantine iconographer with 16 years experience. I live and studied iconography in Greece with teachers including master iconographer George Kordis. I have also studied Theology and done post-graduate studies in Liturgics at the University of Athens.
So what are these iconography tutorials about?

This is not a standard weekend iconography workshop where you simply learn to  trace an icon and ""paint-by-numbers"". It was never the tradition of the Church to make ""photocopies"" of old icons, but sadly this modern ""tradition"" is destroying the creative tradition of the Church. Every period of iconography from the Comnene to the Paleologian periods to the Cretan School has it's own style within the Byzantine system of painting and the iconographic tradition of the Church. In these tutorials you will be  introduced to the Byzantine system of painting and given tools that will allow you create within the tradition of the Church.
It cannot be emphasized enough how important it is for iconographers to learn to draw before starting to paint. That is why with these tutorials we will start by building the foundation by learning how to draw before we progress to painting icons.

The tutorials have subtitles for the deaf.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 3/2024,649.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế khác,Hội họa,3 phần,20 bài giảng,1 giờ 30 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/byzantine-iconography-painting-series-1-painting-basics-3/

Things I like to do in my free time include making music, geeking out over personal finance, traveling to new places, exercising (big calisthenics fan here!), and going out to eat with friends and family.In 2018, I earned my fitness instructor B and A licenses and then embarked on a year-long journey halfway around the globe. I spent the first eight months in Australia, where I enjoyed the freedom of life to the fullest. This was followed by three months of pure action mixed with hammocking on the beach in Asia. Among other things, I bought a motorcycle in Vietnam and rode along the coast for about 3000km, almost getting killed more than once.Today I continue to work with friends on film and other creative projects, keeping my skills fresh and ready to teach you.I want to show you how to become a better creator, make money with your creations, and live the life you've dreamed of.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",72%,21%,6%,1%,< 1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 11/2023,1.739.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Công cụ thiết kế,Ứng dụng vẽ hình minh họa kỹ thuật số Procreate,5 phần,91 bài giảng,18 giờ 14 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/procreate-masterclass/

I'm a South African born byzantine iconographer with 16 years experience. I live and studied iconography in Greece with teachers including master iconographer George Kordis. I have also studied Theology and done post-graduate studies in Liturgics at the University of Athens.
So what are these iconography tutorials about?

This is not a standard weekend iconography workshop where you simply learn to  trace an icon and ""paint-by-numbers"". It was never the tradition of the Church to make ""photocopies"" of old icons, but sadly this modern ""tradition"" is destroying the creative tradition of the Church. Every period of iconography from the Comnene to the Paleologian periods to the Cretan School has it's own style within the Byzantine system of painting and the iconographic tradition of the Church. In these tutorials you will be  introduced to the Byzantine system of painting and given tools that will allow you create within the tradition of the Church.
It cannot be emphasized enough how important it is for iconographers to learn to draw before starting to paint. That is why with these tutorials we will start by building the foundation by learning how to draw before we progress to painting icons.

She quickly began designing, sewing and selling made-to-measure women's wear and specialty garments including bridal gowns.  
  	      Maree then became a fully qualified Kwik-Sew consultant, got married, had two children and set sail on a new journey to share her knowledge, skills and passion for fashion design and sewing by launching her very own Sewing School. From humble beginnings in her back garage in 1979 she quickly grew her business adapting to changing trends of fashion and class structure through various stores in Geelong - to where it is today, Rosewood Cottage Studio on her family property in 23 Kalkarra Crescent Mt. Duneed, Victoria Australia. 
  	      2005 saw Maree join forces with her daughter Jacqueline, to team together in a partnership to bring her business online. It has always been Maree’s dream to capture her sewing ideas, techniques and skills to teach others all around the world who share her love for sewing and creating.  
 Jacqueline has an IT background and is a Life and Business Coach and was the perfect person to help turn her mum’s dream into a reality. Working together, planning, designing and creating – together their aim is to touch the lives of other creative women in a positive, enriching and fun way in the world of sewing, designing and dressmaking skills.  
  	      Jacqueline, is like her mum, a very talented designer and sewer and has been working with her mother for as long as she can remember. From designing and modeling in fashion parades Maree hosted, to assisting with classes and the development of the business, Jacqueline works hard behind and sometimes in front of the camera to create online sewing courses to launch on Udemy. With Jacqueline's extensive travels around the world she is always bringing new and exciting course ideas to the team.  
 For the past 15 years Maree and Jacqueline have been designing for Australian Stitches Magazine and Maree won the Australian Craft of Excellent Awards in both 1998 & 1999. 
  	      When not sewing or teaching Maree loves to be in her established rose garden and rose room which is filled with hundreds of roses and gorgeous student areas. Maree loves to get out her garden shears to prune her roses! She adores spending time developing her native garden and watching her delicious organic vegetable garden and orchard grow! Maree’s beautiful Border collie Rosie helps her by eating the strawberries and tomatoes when visiting for constant pats and affection.  
  	      Maree has had great success in river boat rowing, being taught by her Australian Rowing Champion daughter Jacqueline she herself trained, practiced and learnt the core skills of rowing to go on and win 2 silver medals in the Australian Indoor Rowing Championships Veterans (2007).  
  	      Since then Maree keeps fit on her own indoor rowing machine and mixes her routine with running stairs and walking on her local coastal beaches with a bunch of her wonderful friends in Victoria.  
  	      Maree and Jacqueline's unique mother and daughter team provide excellent sewing classes and sewing tuition, fashion design, wardrobe planning, sewing techniques and just love making online sewing courses for Udemy for beginners as well as all ages and levels of sewing to come soon too!  
  	      Maree also enjoys patchwork, quilting and most creative hobbies, spending time with her family, her mother who also lives in Geelong as well as friends in her local area and travelling internationally to visit her son Matthew and his wife Cameron and their two children Poppy and Felix in Switzerland.

 TESTIMONIALS 
 Thank you Maree for a brilliant Zero To Sewing beginner clinic. I am surprised with how much I have learnt in only 2 days! I can't wait to practice my new skills and make my next sewing project. 
 Shelley Threlfall 
 I attended the Zero To Sewing in a Weekend course and loved it! I have learnt so much and have been inspired to continue on with my own sewing projects. 
 Jamie Brown 
 I have loved the sewing classes, they were so much fun and Maree is so friendly and warm and is a pleasure to learn from. 
 Kelly Hosking 
 Maree is a fabulous teacher! A perfect pace for me, very clear and encouraging. I feel so excited to move forwards and try new sewing projects now! 
 Katrina Stroud 
 The Zero To Sewing in a Weekend - Beginner sewing clinic was fantastic as a self taught sewer to learn how to do things properly! I thought I knew more than I actually did... now I know how to do all of those things and more because of Maree! 
 Elizabeth Gordon 
 I had booked into Maree’s sewing classes, where I made my first pair of pyjamas.  Since then, I have gone on and made 4 compete sets and 5 bottom pants.  I have now moved onto making a fully lined vest and have made 3 after I enrolled for a full term of lessons.  I am booked in again for another term and will be a student for a very long time.  People ask me why I travel so far to learn how to sew? The answer I give is simple. I wanted to learn from the best and am being taught by a master!  Maree Pigdon apart from being a lovely person, is truly a master of sewing.  Maree not only knows how to sew, Maree knows how to teach others. Nothing is too much for her and her attention to detail is something above the rest. Maree knows what is going on even when she is in a far corner.  My advice to anyone who is serious about learning how to sew, then do not waste your time or money, go to the master, Maree Pigdon.

 Maree’s wealth of knowledge is amazing and so practical and appreciated.

I thought that if I got rid of the thing, I'd lose the memory. I found out that wasn't true. A photograph could very easily take me back to the weekend, the concert, the family gathering, even to the thrill of finding that new miniature shoe.This led me to look for ways to make virtual photo albums that looked good, were low-tech, and hopefully didn't cost a lot of money. I'd already spent enough on this stuff and didn't need to spend any more.This is how the course 'TShirt Memory Album' started. I made a few for myself, then gave templates to a few people, then I wrote the course.It uses free software, (Canva) so there isn't anything to buy after the course.

Professor Brick Maker - PBM) and I’ve always had a deep love of miniatures and designing and building with Lego bricks.  My Lego renaissance happened when I received the original Forest Hideout as a birthday gift.  Years later I saw the movie “Toy Story” and again my mind was blown.  I had to know how to animate characters like the ones I saw in that incredible movie, so I left my family business and began researching animation schools in Northern California.I studied Character Animation at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and got a job with an awesome game studio called Munkyfun.  While working as an animator I began a company called Brick Brigade, prototyping and kitting Lego military models to sell online and at conventions.  At my very first convention in 2010 called Bricks by the Bay in Fremont, I made great friends, sold a bunch of kits and met Dan from Brickmania.After having great success with Brick Brigade, in 2017 I decided to join forces with Brickmania and went to work with Dan and his awesome crew in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I contributed my abilities to the success of Brickmania and over the years have designed and prototyped lots of building kits for the company.  I was known for adding a bit of whimsy to the kits that I designed and some on-screen silliness during the taping of the Brickmania's ""at the designers desk"" videos.  After about two and a half years working for Brickmania at their headquarters in Minnesota, I returned to California and continued to design prototypes for the company.  I also attended several Lego fan conventions and other Lego related events as their representative, promoting Brickmania and their stores.  While attending Lego events, I was often asked, “How do I get started making Lego Prototypes?”.  So I began creating these courses for Lego model building fans. Those that want to take their designs to the next level.  While most of prototyping involves one’s individual vision, there is some very useful information and techniques I’ve gathered along my journey that I look forward to sharing with all of you.My hope is by sharing my knowledge, I can help inspire you to build more precise, historically accurate and awesome minifig scale models made from the bricks we love.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 6/2023,499.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế khác,Làm đồ thủ công,4 phần,14 bài giảng,1 giờ 12 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/building-from-blueprints-with-lego-bricks-vehicle-edition/

I coach authors and writers how to write their books in such a way that THEY BENEFIT even when they give their books away.How is that possible? It's actually pretty easy, barely an inconvenience. Authors should be including 'calls-to-action' and access to additional content within their books to incentivize readers to visit their websites and collect email addresses.They should also include links to their social media profiles within their books.And they should also use their websites to give away sample chapters (or other types of digital lead magnets) to collect email addresses and build a valuable email list of interested readers and prospective customers. You want to get your book into as many people's hands as possible and, if you're a new author, giving away books can be a lot easier than selling books.I teach my clients about the 80/20 rule of book marketing this way:Give away 1,000 books (these can be digital so no cost).20% of those people (200) will JOIN your email list.20% of those people (40) will BUY SOMETHING from you (physical book, online course, membership, webinar training, etc.).20% of those people (8) will BUY WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE SELLING such as coaching or consulting.To find these EIGHT CLIENTS, you give away 1,000 books.

Starting out in more traditional mediums I cut my teeth in pencil, charcoal, and acrylic painting until discovering tattooing. This began a love affair with art and lead me to open 7th seasons studios. Nothing inspires a higher level of perfection than knowing the client will walk around with my art for the rest of their lives. After completing a masters in business and having to manage the marketing of a successful shop I quickly realized that the future of art is digital and I began making my own show banners and managing my own website.

Teaching allows us to do that, sometimes it is teaching engineering, sometimes writing, and sometimes digital art and film production We primarily work with small businesses and solo entrepreneurs with no staff and no budget showing them how to make the most of their valuable time to deliver their vision for their business to the clients they serve...this is why our training catalog has such a wide variety of offerings in terms of platforms and skills......because these are the skills we wish we had when we started 7th season. Feel free to reach out using the Q&A if there are issues or questions on the courses I post Hiện thêmẨn bớt",61%,30%,7%,1%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 9/2023,419.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế & Minh họa đồ họa,Affinity Designer,6 phần,83 bài giảng,9 giờ 4 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-affinity-designer-for-ipad-course/

I'm a South African born byzantine iconographer with 16 years experience. I live and studied iconography in Greece with teachers including master iconographer George Kordis. I have also studied Theology and done post-graduate studies in Liturgics at the University of Athens.
So what are these iconography tutorials about?

This is not a standard weekend iconography workshop where you simply learn to  trace an icon and ""paint-by-numbers"". It was never the tradition of the Church to make ""photocopies"" of old icons, but sadly this modern ""tradition"" is destroying the creative tradition of the Church. Every period of iconography from the Comnene to the Paleologian periods to the Cretan School has it's own style within the Byzantine system of painting and the iconographic tradition of the Church. In these tutorials you will be  introduced to the Byzantine system of painting and given tools that will allow you create within the tradition of the Church.
It cannot be emphasized enough how important it is for iconographers to learn to draw before starting to paint. That is why with these tutorials we will start by building the foundation by learning how to draw before we progress to painting icons.

Once I do that, I would want to know how to analyze performance of my design and I would have gone for STA-1, STA-2  and Timing ECO webinar courses, respectivelyOnce you STA, there’s an internal curiosity which rises, and wants us to understand, what goes inside timing analysis at transistor level. To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts. So for that, I would start to learn TCL-Part1 and TCL-Part2 courses, at very beginning or in middleFinally, if I want to learn RTL and synthesis, from specifications to layout, RISC-V ISA course will teach the best way to define specs for a complex system like microprocessor Connect with me for more guidance !!   Hope you enjoy the session best of luck for future Kunal

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

Once I do that, I would want to know how to analyze performance of my design and I would have gone for STA-1, STA-2  and Timing ECO webinar courses, respectivelyOnce you STA, there’s an internal curiosity which rises, and wants us to understand, what goes inside timing analysis at transistor level. To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts. So for that, I would start to learn TCL-Part1 and TCL-Part2 courses, at very beginning or in middleFinally, if I want to learn RTL and synthesis, from specifications to layout, RISC-V ISA course will teach the best way to define specs for a complex system like microprocessor Connect with me for more guidance !!   Hope you enjoy the session best of luck for future Kunal

With decades of experience in web design and development, I've built thousands of projects, including custom PHP scripts and WordPress themes used by various companies.My journey into teaching began during the Covid-19 pandemic when traditional training institutes closed their doors. I transitioned to online platforms like many others, but I sought a more efficient way to share my knowledge. That's when I discovered Udemy, and I was inspired to create courses that could empower learners by teaching once and reaching many.As a self-taught web designer and developer, I believe in a hands-on approach to learning. My teaching philosophy follows the 80/20 rule, where 80% of my courses focus on practical applications, while only 20% covers theory. This method ensures that my students gain the essential skills needed to excel in the ever-evolving world of web development.I’m also an internet enthusiast, constantly researching dynamic projects to create innovative solutions.

I have become an expert in Adobe Illustrator for fashion design, 3D garment design and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management). When implemented and trained correctly all of these solutions help fashion retailers get products to market quicker and more efficiently with less costly mistakes making them invaluable to the industry today.Many fashion students are graduating knowing nothing or little about these applications that are so critical to the product development process. One of the main complaints from fashion retailers and brands are that graduates lack key skills required by industry. Because the learning curve for these applications can be steep, and there are so many skills that fashion students need to acquire it is very difficult for universities to provide comprehensive training in everything within their fashion design programs.There are also many people working in the industry today that have received little formal training on these applications. For example many fashion designers may use Adobe Illustrator but do not adhere to any drawing standards or best practises so have problems such as not being able to easily edit each other's drawings, create colourways quickly or create reusable components properly, making them inefficient. When designers, buyers or merchandisers want to perhaps start a new job, if that company is already using PLM, it can be very daunting to suddenly find you are expected to adopt an entirely new way of working if your previous company didn't work this way.I am passionate about how creative IT applications can support both the creative design and product development process and now want to be able to share my skills and experience with students worldwide.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",57%,30%,9%,3%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 5/2021,1.139.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế thời trang,Thời trang,6 phần,29 bài giảng,5 giờ 11 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-draw-fashion-with-adobe-illustrator-cc-intermediate/

Once I do that, I would want to know how to analyze performance of my design and I would have gone for STA-1, STA-2  and Timing ECO webinar courses, respectivelyOnce you STA, there’s an internal curiosity which rises, and wants us to understand, what goes inside timing analysis at transistor level. To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts. So for that, I would start to learn TCL-Part1 and TCL-Part2 courses, at very beginning or in middleFinally, if I want to learn RTL and synthesis, from specifications to layout, RISC-V ISA course will teach the best way to define specs for a complex system like microprocessor Connect with me for more guidance !!   Hope you enjoy the session best of luck for future Kunal

The simplest way to put this is that I like making games. So much so that I've delved into every aspect of their creation from art and animation to programming and sound. If I had to narrow it down though, my biggest passions within this field are 3d modeling and FX animation.I studied Digital Arts at Chapman University and I'm honored to have won the ""Best Art"" award from the IEEE GameSIG competition two years in a row. As a freelancer, I enjoy working on a wide variety of projects. From small indie teams to multi-million dollar foreign companies, I love it all and look forward to the challenges and experience that each has to offer. Most recently, I developed a VR experience to show off an AI program at a technology conference in South Korea. It was an amazing experience that helped me practice doing more abstract art styles as opposed to my usual realistic models and effects.During the summers, I teach at a company called Digital Media Academy (DMA) where I teach topics like VFX, 3d modeling, and game development to high school students. The courses there are pretty fast paced because we have to compress about a college course's worth of curriculum into a one week bootcamp. Thankfully, this means that I now know how to compress and distill new ideas and techniques to their most crucial components so that YOU can learn them as fast as possible and get on the road to creating your own amazing games, models, and effects.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",63%,28%,7%,1%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 3/2018,1.309.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,Hiệu ứng hình ảnh (VFX),8 phần,60 bài giảng,6 giờ 17 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-particle-vfx-in-unity-and-after-effects/

My name is Andrzej Pach (but Andrew is easier to say ^^) and I spend my daily time with graphic design, presentations, motion & animation, typography, video editing, and online teaching. Most of my work is done in Adobe After Effects & Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 / 2021 / 365 and Camtasia so naturally, this is the software I want to teach about and share my experience with. I have completed more than 5000 graphic projects for clients, mostly including video animations like intros, outros, and transitions for various YouTube channels & marketers. On Fiverr alone (a freelancing website), I have more than 3500 reviews and 4k+ finished jobs. I would like to share with you the knowledge that I was able to ""stack up"" during the process. I am always willing to help people out by enhancing their brands and projects.    	Who am I?  I'm born in 1989, live in a small village in Poland, and graduated from my University in July 2014. A few years back, when I tried to find my ""place"" after getting hired to prepare a website, flyer, and business card for a local business in my area, I finally ""felt it"". Since then (2011) I have expanded my skills in this area by completing various graphic, website, and design-related projects. Places like the Warrior Forum, freelancing websites, and graphic contests across the web caught my interest and never let me go. I run my own company since April 2015.  	What is the next step?  I've gathered experience by working for several years as a freelancer with a keen focus on handling creative projects ranging from very small businesses to brands and YouTube channels with over 500k subscribers. Now I’m looking forward to sharing my knowledge by creating exciting courses that are easy to follow - and most importantly - USEFUL to you. I am looking to work with forward-thinking people who seek to create something original and catchy that will reinforce their brand and follow their vibe. I’m always committed to providing value while giving away random tips to make your workflow easier, no matter what we work on.    	What are my mission and passion? I believe in making the Web Business and Internet Media world a better place because my actions will affect (and hopefully positively shape) my followers, friends, family, and future generations. Since I live in a small village where people work in agriculture or do physical labor, I set the goal for myself to be a sort of pioneer in the web-based business field, growing myself as a designer every single day.    You can always contact me, as I don't mind talking to anyone about how I might help your business or about what course topics I might record if you like my teaching style.       To your success, Andrew (Andrzej in Polish) ;)Hiện thêmẨn bớt",61%,28%,9%,2%,< 1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 2/2025,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,Adobe After Effects,12 phần,85 bài giảng,6 giờ 54 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/aftereffects-beginners-complete/

Once I do that, I would want to know how to analyze performance of my design and I would have gone for STA-1, STA-2  and Timing ECO webinar courses, respectivelyOnce you STA, there’s an internal curiosity which rises, and wants us to understand, what goes inside timing analysis at transistor level. To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts. So for that, I would start to learn TCL-Part1 and TCL-Part2 courses, at very beginning or in middleFinally, if I want to learn RTL and synthesis, from specifications to layout, RISC-V ISA course will teach the best way to define specs for a complex system like microprocessor Connect with me for more guidance !!   Hope you enjoy the session best of luck for future Kunal

Joe has a bachelor of media arts from the Waikato Institute of Technology. He teaches Art part time at Naenae College in Lower Hutt, Wellington. Joe loves teaching Art, and gets lots of the ideas for his work through interactions with his classes. His students also experience first-hand the different processes involved in his prints, drawings and paintings.In Joe’s latest series of nautical themed screen prints his detailed drawings are screen printed as a ship and anchor or a deep sea diver. Joe then carefully drops coloured powdered dye pigment in the midst of the image, and the colours splash across the print, making each one bright, exquisite and unique. He finishes the print with some hand drawn pattern to represent the water.Joe’s recent paintings depict a range of subjects painted directly onto the medium of plywood - it is a natural medium that attracts him and he makes the frames for each piece by hand. He is interested in New Zealand native birds. Joe skilfully paints these birds directly onto the plywood, which gives them a raw quality and showcases his photorealistic painting technique. He often applies a layer of Danish oil overtop, which brings out the grain of the wood and the jewel-like paint colours.At the end of 2015 Joe resealed the NZ Native Birds adult colouring book. It was a great success with the first edition of 500 books selling out in 2 weeks. The second edition is available in the shop. He has a number of exciting projects happening this year, including video drawing and painting courses on Udemy, a mural, the Christchurch Art show and many more.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",83%,13%,4%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 5/2016,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế khác,Hội họa,9 phần,41 bài giảng,2 giờ 25 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/paint-a-realistic-bird-using-acrylics/

I am passionate about learning and teaching. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
After building websites for friends and family, I soon realized that becoming a professional Designer and Web Developer was a lucrative and challenging choice. I love programming but I also love designing... so developing websites, games and mobile apps are an excellent place to combine them. I've founded a web design and development agency almost 15 years ago, and I'm also the founder of some other startups (Brainvard, BrainvardGames, InviteSpace (currently offline), Masmind) among others.
My profile and skills combine the artistic and technical fields in equal proportions, so I am in balance between both worlds.
You wouldn't believe the freedom that being a designer and web developer offers. 
My goal is to teach you everything I know so you can enjoy the journey of learning and of course make money working when and where you want in the word!

My name is Andrzej Pach (but Andrew is easier to say ^^) and I spend my daily time with graphic design, presentations, motion & animation, typography, video editing, and online teaching. Most of my work is done in Adobe After Effects & Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 / 2021 / 365 and Camtasia so naturally, this is the software I want to teach about and share my experience with. I have completed more than 5000 graphic projects for clients, mostly including video animations like intros, outros, and transitions for various YouTube channels & marketers. On Fiverr alone (a freelancing website), I have more than 3500 reviews and 4k+ finished jobs. I would like to share with you the knowledge that I was able to ""stack up"" during the process. I am always willing to help people out by enhancing their brands and projects.    	Who am I?  I'm born in 1989, live in a small village in Poland, and graduated from my University in July 2014. A few years back, when I tried to find my ""place"" after getting hired to prepare a website, flyer, and business card for a local business in my area, I finally ""felt it"". Since then (2011) I have expanded my skills in this area by completing various graphic, website, and design-related projects. Places like the Warrior Forum, freelancing websites, and graphic contests across the web caught my interest and never let me go. I run my own company since April 2015.  	What is the next step?  I've gathered experience by working for several years as a freelancer with a keen focus on handling creative projects ranging from very small businesses to brands and YouTube channels with over 500k subscribers. Now I’m looking forward to sharing my knowledge by creating exciting courses that are easy to follow - and most importantly - USEFUL to you. I am looking to work with forward-thinking people who seek to create something original and catchy that will reinforce their brand and follow their vibe. I’m always committed to providing value while giving away random tips to make your workflow easier, no matter what we work on.    	What are my mission and passion? I believe in making the Web Business and Internet Media world a better place because my actions will affect (and hopefully positively shape) my followers, friends, family, and future generations. Since I live in a small village where people work in agriculture or do physical labor, I set the goal for myself to be a sort of pioneer in the web-based business field, growing myself as a designer every single day.    You can always contact me, as I don't mind talking to anyone about how I might help your business or about what course topics I might record if you like my teaching style.       To your success, Andrew (Andrzej in Polish) ;)Hiện thêmẨn bớt",60%,31%,8%,1%,< 1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 2/2025,419.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,PowerPoint,4 phần,20 bài giảng,52 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/powerpoint-kinetic-typography/

To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts.

I have had quite a range of skills and hobbies throughout my lifetime. I really enjoy teaching and hope to provide information to others on anything and everything I know how to do. Please take a moment to check out my courses, and if you take any please leave a review and any feedback you have.BusinessStarting my own business in 2015 has led me down some interesting and wonderful paths in my lifetime. I've learned the ins and outs of management, marketing, accounting, sales, and other aspects of a business environment. The skills I've learned through podcasting, blogging, creating videos, and marketing is something I will carry the rest of my life into many other endeavors.Art and DesignI have an extensive background in different forms of art and design. I have an Associate's Degree in Computer Animation and I've worked with various production houses to create awesome content. Adobe Photoshop has been a staple of my arsenal since I was 16 and I still use it faithfully to this day.I also have a history in live visual arts, specifically lighting design for music events, festivals, theaters, and corporate gigs. My passion for the visual arts has helped me become a master in understanding lighting, color theory, and composition.MusicOne of the first things I did as a young lad was learning music. Music is so powerful and one of my favorite things in life. I love playing music and have played various instruments; including guitar, bass guitar, drums, violin, and the saxophone.I feel music can provide so many emotions and feelings, and also has scientific and mathematical characteristics. It is such a fun topic and I can't wait to begin creating courses on this subject.ProductivityBeing a Capricorn and an INTJ means I am destined for organization and time management. I have a strong leaning toward seeing the bigger picture and finding ways to stay productive while working on different tasks and projects. Productivity, time management, project management, spreadsheets, and to-do lists are staples of my everyday work, and love teaching these skills to others.Math, Science, and HistoryI can't tell you what the latest Kardashian is up to, but I can definitely tell you a lot about Crab Fisheries and the Egyptian King Khufu. Typically when I am studying something outside of the art and music realm, it has to do with math, science, and history. I'm just drawn to man's accomplishments and new ways of thinking about things.Healthy Eating and ExerciseTo live a long and balanced life, you need to eat right and take care of your body. It's a mission of mine to make sure that I am in the best physical shape so that I can be around long enough to provide for my family. If there's any courses that I can feel like I really can give back, it would be explaining to others how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I mean, if you're not healthy, how can you help anyone else out?I've also been very active in sports throughout my life. Usually, these are extreme sports such as skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding. I'm also a big fan of running, mountain biking, and have taken various martial art forms in the past.That explains a little about me and my background.

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

This sealed the deal and digital art has replaced the traditional pen an ink for me. Furthermore the industry has changed to such a degree that more and more clients and artists are demanding digital skills i the design and application of art, and so I saw a significantly under served market in people with existing talent, but lacking digital As a career teacher the most rewarding portion of what i do is seeing someone learn what they previously thought what out of reach and gain a confidence through the learning process....I identify with that because i m a firm believer in the beginner mindset and the idea of a life long learner. To me, art is as essential as breathing and I cannot even narrow down all the ways I express myself through various mediums, that is one of the best competitive advantages I feel we have at 7th season.....we are constantly curious. I believe every person has within them a desire to create something out of life....and many times they lack the skills to realize this. 7th season studios is about taking this need and in reality changing ""I wish""....to ""I am glad I did"". Teaching allows us to do that, sometimes it is teaching engineering, sometimes writing, and sometimes digital art and film production We primarily work with small businesses and solo entrepreneurs with no staff and no budget showing them how to make the most of their valuable time to deliver their vision for their business to the clients they serve...this is why our training catalog has such a wide variety of offerings in terms of platforms and skills......because these are the skills we wish we had when we started 7th season. Feel free to reach out using the Q&A if there are issues or questions on the courses I post Hiện thêmẨn bớt",72%,23%,3%,2%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 10/2018,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế & Minh họa đồ họa,Affinity Designer,8 phần,40 bài giảng,4 giờ 57 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/affinity-designer-design-artistic-text-and-create-fonts/

I wanted freedom... badly. Freedom from work, freedom from boredom, and, most of all, the freedom to choose. This simple idea grew to define me; it made me become an entrepreneur.    	          As I strived to gain freedom, overtime I realized that with everything that you do you can either (1) convince someone, somehow, to do it with you or (2) figure out how to do it yourself.    	            Due to a lack of financial resources (and probably the ability to convince people to do high quality work for free), I decided to learn. Then learn some more. Then some more. My path of learning website design started a long time ago. And yes, it was out of need not desire. I believed I needed a website for a company that I started. So I learned how to do it. The company died, my skills lived on... and got better and better.    	            It took me a while after learning web design (html/css) to actually start learning programming (web application, storing ""data"", user logins, etc). I tinkered with Wordpress, believing it could be a ""user"" site, but I was mistaken. Sure there are/were hacks for that, but they were hacks/work-arounds and simply not-what-wordpress-was-indended-to-be. Wordpress is for blogs/content. Plain and simple.    	            I wanted more. I had a web application idea that I thought would change the way restaurants hire their service staff. I tested it with my basic html/css skills, had great initial results, and found a technical (programmer) cofounder as a result. He was awesome. We were featured on CNN. Things looked great.    	            Until... cash-flow was a no-flow. Business? I think not. More like an avid hobby. We had the idea for a business just no business. Naturally, my partner had to find a means of income so I was left with the idea on its own.    	            Remember how I said everything we do has 2 choices. Well I tried the convincing. Now it was time to try the learning. I opted to learn and haven't looked back since. I tried almost every language out there: PHP, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Objective C, C++, Java, Javascript. I was lost.    	            Then, I tried Python. I was hooked. It was so easy. So simple. So elegant.    	            Then, I tried Django. Even more hooked. Made from python & made for web applications. It powers Instagram & Pinterest (two of the hottest web apps right now?).    	            Then, I tried Bootstrap. Simple and easy front-end design (html & css) that is super easy to use, mobile-ready, and overall... incredible.    	          Python, Django, and Bootstrap are truly changing the way the world builds web applications. I believe it's because of the simplicity to learn, the sheer power behind them, and, most of all, the plethora of resources to aid anyone in building their web projects (from packages to tutorials to q&a sites).    	          I relaunched my original venture with my new found skills. That wasn't enough. It didn't compel me as it once had. I started imagining all the possibilities of all the ideas I've always wanted to implement. Now I could. Which one to start with? There were so many good ideas...    	          Then another idea, a new & fresh idea, started brewing. I started to believe in the power of learning these skills. What would it mean if other non-technical entrepreneurs could learn? What would it mean if ideas were executed quickly, revenue models proven, all prior to approaching the highly sought-after programmers? What would it mean if entrepreneurs became coders?    	          And so. Coding for Entrepreneurs was born.    	            Here are some bio highlights:  Adjunct Professor of Entrepreneurship at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern CaliforniaBestselling instructor on UdemyFunded creator on KickstarterFounder of Coding For EntrepreneursCohost of Backer RadioHiện thêmẨn bớt",29%,39%,22%,6%,4%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 9/2014,469.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,In 3D,4 phần,9 bài giảng,44 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-started-with-3d-printing/

His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above.

Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance.

Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets.

Starting out in more traditional mediums I cut my teeth in pencil, charcoal, and acrylic painting until discovering tattooing. This began a love affair with art and lead me to open 7th seasons studios. Nothing inspires a higher level of perfection than knowing the client will walk around with my art for the rest of their lives. After completing a masters in business and having to manage the marketing of a successful shop I quickly realized that the future of art is digital and I began making my own show banners and managing my own website. This sealed the deal and digital art has replaced the traditional pen an ink for me. Furthermore the industry has changed to such a degree that more and more clients and artists are demanding digital skills i the design and application of art, and so I saw a significantly under served market in people with existing talent, but lacking digital As a career teacher the most rewarding portion of what i do is seeing someone learn what they previously thought what out of reach and gain a confidence through the learning process....I identify with that because i m a firm believer in the beginner mindset and the idea of a life long learner. To me, art is as essential as breathing and I cannot even narrow down all the ways I express myself through various mediums, that is one of the best competitive advantages I feel we have at 7th season.....we are constantly curious. I believe every person has within them a desire to create something out of life....and many times they lack the skills to realize this. 7th season studios is about taking this need and in reality changing ""I wish""....to ""I am glad I did"". Teaching allows us to do that, sometimes it is teaching engineering, sometimes writing, and sometimes digital art and film production We primarily work with small businesses and solo entrepreneurs with no staff and no budget showing them how to make the most of their valuable time to deliver their vision for their business to the clients they serve...this is why our training catalog has such a wide variety of offerings in terms of platforms and skills......because these are the skills we wish we had when we started 7th season. Feel free to reach out using the Q&A if there are issues or questions on the courses I post Hiện thêmẨn bớt",74%,24%,2%,< 1%,< 1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 5/2021,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế & Minh họa đồ họa,Affinity Designer,11 phần,76 bài giảng,8 giờ 50 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/t-shirt-design-in-affinity-designer-for-desktop/

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

His primary focus is commercial art, creating everything from storyboards and animatics to final art and finished animation.  Over the years Chris has developed unique strategies and skills that have allowed him a nation-wide agency reputation for continuously delivering high volumes of exceptional art on tight deadlines, and doing it all on budget.​In addition, Chris is also recognized globally for his work in genre publishing (for example his work on Star Wars Comics and books.) He is also known for his original work and tutorials centered around fantasy, and photo realism art.​Chris started drawing as a young boy and was influenced by his love for the sci fi and fantasy genres. He never had any formal art training which allowed him to discover un-conventional routes giving us today’s exceptional work. His first published art was with G-Fan magazine which lead to working with companies such as Dark Horse Comics and Maximum Press, and eventually publishing his own comics under the Realm Press banner. Those early experiences taught him how to face grueling deadlines and conditioned him to turn around high volumes of quality art in a short periods of time. In those days, it was all traditional art, and difficult to produce giving Chris the incentive to explore and embrace the developing digital world. Chris was then able to harness his newly developed talent into becoming one of the countries top commercial artists we know today, currently working for many adverting agencies and publishers.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",79%,7%,14%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 11/2018,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế & Minh họa đồ họa,Vẽ hoạt hình,1 phần,12 bài giảng,2 giờ 14 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-draw-and-paint-cartoon-characters-digitally/

Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

Furthermore, knowledge in the how-to are not commonly found in the internet and a lot of times individual teams would only keep knowledge to themselves. This means that even if you are working in these companies, chances are that you may not get the overall picture as much as you hope.Most people may feel paralyzed and don't know where to start in how to get into the industry or to gain more industrial knowledge. Even worse, most training courses provided by industry leaders are available only to certain employees of their business clients. Power utility industry provides one of the most basic of needs in modern society and is also one of the industry that will experience rapid growth within the next twenty years. This industry needs professionals like YOU to make electricity more accessible and affordable for the present and the future. Mike believes that the knowledge and skills in this industry should be affordable and open to all. These courses should teach real life skills that are applicable to the industry and help students in landing their dream job; they should not waste a student's valuable time. Having learned important lessons from working in both engineering and utility companies, Mike will teach you the foundations that will help launch your career in the power utility industry.Mike promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained catering specifically to the power utility industry.

I had a passion for video games and its creative work for as long as I remember. I began making 3D assets and working for Unity game engine, creating props using 3ds Max and texturing them using manual Photoshop workflow, while baking my normal maps with Xnormal software. During my time as a game artist I also had a chance to get some experience working with Quixel texturing software as well so all in all this versatility coming from me using a variety of programs gave me new perspectives towards modelling each and every piece of work. The main projects which I had the chance to work on were mobile and real-time strategy games, which gave me gave me the chance to polish my optimisation skills for game assets to bring up the best performance within the games.Afterwards I decided to expand my horizons and picked up new skillsets using different software in order to make a higher quality artwork. Now my workflow consists of mainly working within Maya, Zbrush, Substance Painter and Unreal Engine 4. I went on using these programs as it worked better with my personal pipeline, allowing me work on the artwork that focuses more towards realism while still leaving me with the creative freedom to work on more abstract work.I enjoy learning of new and interesting techniques to work on and finding exciting ways on implementing them within my projects.

With expertise rooted in AI technology and generative art, professional photography, and videography, I’ve not only witnessed the evolution of visual art but have also been an active contributor to its narrative.With over 35 years of experience beginning as a traditional cartoon animator and cameraman, I transitioned into the realm of digital artistry, where pixels and palettes converge. My educational journey led me to acquire degrees equivalent to a Master's in Computer Science, Marketing, and various other disciplines, enriching my artistic pursuits.Boasting over 3000+ individual video and printed tutorials, my teachings transcend conventional learning, weaving intricate tapestries of knowledge, skill, and creativity. I am a published author, having contributed to magazines and books, and have even penned my own comprehensive guide on creating mesmerizing 3D environments with Vue.As a commercial designer and artist, every piece of art I create is infused with a unique blend of traditional compositing techniques and cutting-edge AI technology. My work in AI generative art stands as a testament to the seamless fusion of technology and human creativity, painting vivid imagery that transcends the ordinary.Hundreds of commercial digital compositions bear my signature touch. Each piece is a narrative of the refined and polished techniques honed over the years and enriched by continuous learning and adaptation. Workshops, live classes, and a wealth of resources available on my website and YouTube channel are platforms where I share this amassed knowledge, offering insights, techniques, and inspirations.Now, I bring this eclectic mix of skills, experiences, and a proven teaching methodology to Udemy. A space where learning is an immersive journey, and every lesson is a stepping stone to unleashing unparalleled creative potential.I invite you to this enriching experience, a journey where artistry and technology meet, where every lesson learned and skill acquired is a beacon guiding you to new creative horizons, enhancing your professional journey, attracting clients, and elevating the value of your art.The canvas of learning and creativity is vast and waiting. Together, let’s paint it with knowledge, skill, innovation, and artistry.

I discovered my passion for fashion early on. I was educated in the Cotswolds. British born, I made my fashion debut in the 80's.
Coming from a design background I have a BA Honours degree in Fashion and Textiles Design, and History of Art. With an eye for detail and a passion for anything creative, fashion has always been intrinsically important in everything I do.
How did you get started in fashion design?
My fashion aesthetic and strong designs are qualities which have established me as a designer of the more innovative stylists. My strength is accessory design, and my first assignment was as a young designer for The Mulberry Company Design Ltd, before launching myself into my own successful fashion design business.
As an accessory designer I took my love and inspiration from the history and culture from Italy's Le Marche region.  Le Marche is a land of ancient traditions and crafts manufacturing, here, are located some of the major brands famous all over the world. I feel in love with the shoe making district of Fermo and Macerata situated on the border of the provinces of the same name, where  is still the largest concentration of footwear producing companies in Italy. 
Current Expertise
Now, I have entered a new chapter in my career, writing/developing and designing courses, and helping budding young fashion designers with their first step up onto the catwalk of success.
Since 2009, I built my own brand and business with the lifestyle approach I had always envisioned, and spend much of my time between France, Italy and the UK, where I teach my youngest of four children the 'nitty-gritty' of the fashion industry.
I am passionate, energetic and a highly driven designer, able to think strategically with a creative mindset. I have wide-ranging knowledge and expertise in making collections for different clients and a deep ability as accessories designer. This puts me in the perfect position to inspire a new generation of young designers into the industry.
What do you most enjoy about your job?
I really enjoy helping young people.  I like knowing that someone's life is better because of what I do. With the help of the worldwide web and social media, I am able to give budding young designers a step on the ladder to their dream career, this in itself brings me great satisfaction. 
As well as evaluating prospective students' portfolios. I also help students with important portfolio presentation.
When I'm Not Working
And when I am not working? Well, one of my passions is travel and when I am not discovering new areas in the South of France and Italy, I can be found sipping a Caffè ristretto at Caffè Florian in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy's oldest Café. Here you can be seated in one of the café's frescoed rooms or outside listening to the orchestra in the Piazza, enjoying impeccable service and products of the finest quality!Hiện thêmẨn bớt",42%,38%,12%,4%,4%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 1/2017,429.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế thời trang,Thời trang,7 phần,18 bài giảng,1 giờ 29 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-do-fashion-design-research/

Firstly, a little background about me! I have always been the creative type and always strive to improve and push my creative skills further and further.

  
 

  
As stated above I am already teaching in the UK as a Motion Graphics and VFX lecturer – The difference with my courses will be the fact that they come from an educator, not someone doing this just in their spare time! All my courses focus on teaching and assessment. I will teach you a few skills and then set you an assignment to check that those skills have been learnt. I also see the importance of generating handouts and resources for the student, so I have included these in my courses also!

  
 

  
I have a First-Class BA (HONS) in Visual Effects and motion graphics, and also a Masters in Animation. After working a few years in industry, I would occasionally guest lecture at the college I used to attend. After doing this I decided to go into teaching full time where I achieved my teaching qualification.

  
 

  
Now that I am here on Udemy I hope to further spread my extensive knowledge through my teaching practice! Check out the social media links on my profile and get involved!

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

Major kudos to you for taking the steps to become the person who can make that change happen.As part of the team of Udemy instructors, I work on courses to help you level-up as a professional User Experience (UX) designer.I’m on a mission to create...- entertaining learning that you sail through,- courses that deliver rock-solid strategies and top-tier techniques, and- how-tos that are specific, actionable, and brimming with real-world examples.But ultimately… I’m on a mission to turn YOU into an epic UX Designer.From the trenches:I work to improve the usability, accessibility, and overall glamour of websites, apps, and software. And I do this for a living. My job is to make outdated, ugly, usability messes into seamlessly flowing, delightful, user-friendly beauties. This has been my UX journey.For many years I worked as a senior UX designer for a U.S. government contractor. My job was to use “UX magic” to craft beautiful, inclusively-designed, high-performing web applications for various military branches (e.g. Army, Air Force, Marines, Dept of Homeland Security, Dept of Defense, Centers for Disease Control). My team’s “magic tricks” worked. We brought UX to gov agencies that had never heard of it before. UX believers were born.My UX journey has been full of lessons learned the hard way, real-world on-the-job challenges, and demanding boots-on-the-ground work. But also exciting experiences pitching innovation ideas to executives who were leagues above my rank, winning innovation awards & funding, and working with incredible teams of powerhouses on multi-million dollar projects that impacted millions of users.What I love about UX is that it never stops developing; as I too am a lifelong student of UX. I believe in the mantra, ""To become an expert, you must remain a student”.I’m working to create courses that will level-up your expertise across the UX spectrum.The repertoire I’d like to pass to you:Iterative UX Research –- UX strategy- Lean UX, Agile UX- User & business needs assessment- User research & usability testing- Compiling & communicating findings to decision-makers- Pitching UX ideas, innovation ideas, or just UX in generalIterative UX & UI Design –- Information architectures- Wireframes (sketches and digital)- Mockups (visual UI design, storytelling, branding)- Designing for accessibility (WCAG, Section 508, ADA, and others)- Prototyping, responsive design, interaction design- Living design systems / style guides- Writing for the web- Designer & developer collaborationWhich topic(s) would you like me to put at the top of my list to create a course about?What’s different about my courses:1. We redesign existing UIs together so you can see how to do it (I believe in showing not just telling).2. Many “Ah-ha” moments — We look at existing designs, identify their problems, then you watch as we transform the designs using our best practices.3. Extremely practical and specific — No high-level generalizations, or “it depends”, or plain theory.4. Did I mention real-world examples? Yes, practical, from-the-field tricks.5. Learn from real stories — Nothing sticks to the human brain better than stories. (Yay psychology!)6. Each section ends with an “action summary” (a summary + checklist of action items) — It’s what I do to make my courses really actionable.7. Get ready to be encouraged and uplifted the entire way — These courses are all about YOU and transforming you into the stand-out designer you’re destined to be.How students describe me: “The passion of the instructor is contagious, the examples are on point and the explanations are great. I will definitely recommend this to my colleagues, thank you Liz” —Student, How to Design For Accessibility courseBe proud of yourself for exploring courses; you are taking concrete steps to level-up your expertise, broaden your skillset, and load up your toolbox. You’re going to stand out as a top-tier professional, leagues above others who stopped learning. And I’m delighted to be able to help you on this journey.

My name is Andrzej Pach (but Andrew is easier to say ^^) and I spend my daily time with graphic design, presentations, motion & animation, typography, video editing, and online teaching. Most of my work is done in Adobe After Effects & Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 / 2021 / 365 and Camtasia so naturally, this is the software I want to teach about and share my experience with. I have completed more than 5000 graphic projects for clients, mostly including video animations like intros, outros, and transitions for various YouTube channels & marketers. On Fiverr alone (a freelancing website), I have more than 3500 reviews and 4k+ finished jobs. I would like to share with you the knowledge that I was able to ""stack up"" during the process. I am always willing to help people out by enhancing their brands and projects.    	Who am I?  I'm born in 1989, live in a small village in Poland, and graduated from my University in July 2014. A few years back, when I tried to find my ""place"" after getting hired to prepare a website, flyer, and business card for a local business in my area, I finally ""felt it"". Since then (2011) I have expanded my skills in this area by completing various graphic, website, and design-related projects. Places like the Warrior Forum, freelancing websites, and graphic contests across the web caught my interest and never let me go. I run my own company since April 2015.  	What is the next step?  I've gathered experience by working for several years as a freelancer with a keen focus on handling creative projects ranging from very small businesses to brands and YouTube channels with over 500k subscribers. Now I’m looking forward to sharing my knowledge by creating exciting courses that are easy to follow - and most importantly - USEFUL to you. I am looking to work with forward-thinking people who seek to create something original and catchy that will reinforce their brand and follow their vibe. I’m always committed to providing value while giving away random tips to make your workflow easier, no matter what we work on.    	What are my mission and passion? I believe in making the Web Business and Internet Media world a better place because my actions will affect (and hopefully positively shape) my followers, friends, family, and future generations. Since I live in a small village where people work in agriculture or do physical labor, I set the goal for myself to be a sort of pioneer in the web-based business field, growing myself as a designer every single day.    You can always contact me, as I don't mind talking to anyone about how I might help your business or about what course topics I might record if you like my teaching style.       To your success, Andrew (Andrzej in Polish) ;)Hiện thêmẨn bớt",58%,30%,10%,1%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 2/2025,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,Adobe After Effects,8 phần,45 bài giảng,2 giờ 53 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/after-effects-logo-animation/

In 2017, after 7 years of teaching art at university level I started my own school, The Pencil Room, where I teach drawing and painting classes and workshops. From here I developed The Pencil Room Online, to share my classes in a suitable format for online learning.My approach to teaching drawing is to give my students the skills to draw anything they choose, rather than teaching the steps to drawing just one type of subject. My focus is on changing the way you look at what you see so that you perceive it in a way that can be translated onto paper. Once you can do this, you can draw anything with time and practice.I love the simplicity of drawing and I value doodling from the imagination as much as realistic drawing.

Main Areas of ExpertiseWeb and Graphic DesignOffice ProductivityDigital MarketingWeb DevelopmentA Bit About MeStarting at a young age, I dabbled in digital art and created very complex images with the Paintbrush program on Windows. Yes...pixel by pixel. This was well before I knew that Photoshop existed. Even at that time, though, Photoshop was in it's infancy. Over time, I discovered new and exciting ways to express digital creativity. This included 3D modelling and video production. When I was 22, I chose to pursue a college education and further expand my skills.After obtaining a BA in Multimedia and Design, I did a bit of freelancing in various multimedia areas. This included producing 3D models and graphics for companies, designing video game characters, designing and building websites, designing logos and business identity, and various other opportunities.In my career, I've been a Software Interface Designer, Sr. Web Designer, Marketing Manager, Website Supervisor, and most recently CX Manager. Not only have I expanded my creative knowledge, but I am a bit of a tech junkie as well. I love using new technology and digital tools to improve productivity and efficiency.

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

Once I do that, I would want to know how to analyze performance of my design and I would have gone for STA-1, STA-2  and Timing ECO webinar courses, respectivelyOnce you STA, there’s an internal curiosity which rises, and wants us to understand, what goes inside timing analysis at transistor level. To full-fill that, I would had taken Circuit design and SPICE simulations Part 1 and Part 2 courses.And finally, to understand pre-placed cells, IP’s and STA in even more detail, I would have taken custom layout course and Library Characterization courseAll of above needs to be implemented using a CAD tool and needs to be done faster, for which I would have written TCL or perl scripts.

Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

His primary focus is commercial art, creating everything from storyboards and animatics to final art and finished animation.  Over the years Chris has developed unique strategies and skills that have allowed him a nation-wide agency reputation for continuously delivering high volumes of exceptional art on tight deadlines, and doing it all on budget.​In addition, Chris is also recognized globally for his work in genre publishing (for example his work on Star Wars Comics and books.) He is also known for his original work and tutorials centered around fantasy, and photo realism art.​Chris started drawing as a young boy and was influenced by his love for the sci fi and fantasy genres. He never had any formal art training which allowed him to discover un-conventional routes giving us today’s exceptional work. His first published art was with G-Fan magazine which lead to working with companies such as Dark Horse Comics and Maximum Press, and eventually publishing his own comics under the Realm Press banner. Those early experiences taught him how to face grueling deadlines and conditioned him to turn around high volumes of quality art in a short periods of time. In those days, it was all traditional art, and difficult to produce giving Chris the incentive to explore and embrace the developing digital world. Chris was then able to harness his newly developed talent into becoming one of the countries top commercial artists we know today, currently working for many adverting agencies and publishers.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",63%,22%,11%,3%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 11/2018,1.389.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,Thiết kế & Minh họa đồ họa,Nghệ thuật kỹ thuật số,2 phần,32 bài giảng,7 giờ 37 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-digital-painting-photo-realism-in-photoshop/

Buying a Sinclair ZX81 back in 1982 was the start of a migration to a full time programmer. The ZX81 was quickly swapped for the Sinclair Spectrum, a Z80 processor and a massive 48K of ram made this a much better computer to develop games. I developed a few games using Sinclair Basic and then Assembler. The Spectrum was swapped for a Commodore Amiga and I developed more games in the shareware market, moving to using C. At this stage it was essentially a hobby. Paid work was still animated commercials. I finally bought a PC in the early nineties and completed an Open University degree in Maths and Computing. I created a sprite library ActiveX control and authored my first book, aimed at getting designers into programming. In the mid nineties along came Flash and the company I was now running, Catalyst Pictures, became known for creating games. Since then the majority of my working life has been creating games, first in Flash and Director, as Director published the first widely available 3D library that would run in a browser using a plugin. In recent years game development has involved using HTML5 and Canvas. Using both custom code and various libraries. A particular preference is to use the latest version of Adobe Flash, now called Animate that exports to the Javascript library Createjs. I've worked for the BBC. Johnson and Johnson. Deloitte, Mars Corporation and many other blue chip clients. The company I've run for over 30 years has won a number of awards and been nominated for a BAFTA twice, the UK equivalent to the Oscar. Over the last 20 years I have been struck by just how difficult it has been to get good developers and have decided to do something about this rather than just complain. I run a CodeClub for kids 9-13 years old and I'm developing a number of courses for Udemy hoping to inspire and educate new developers. Most of my courses involve real-time 3d either using the popular Open Source library Three.JS or Unity. I'm currently having a lot of fun developing WebXR games and playing with my Oculus Quest.

After completing B.Tech Biotechnology engineering she worked with a Diagnostics company and within 6 months Firoza decided to print her own world and entered in 3D printing Business. As a biotechnologist, the fact that there is hope to create live organs out of patient's own stem cells someday really intrigued her and became her motivation to be a part of her brother's company SAHAS Softech LLP, a company which deals in 3D printing.In April 2015 with her team, she executed their first case ever in Paediatric Cardiology, which also turned out to be the first case in the country. The child was about 6 months of age and was denied for surgery, but based on the model, they decided that a complete repair can be done and a chance to live a full life can be provided to the kid. The surgery was successful and the child recovered well.Since then, she has gone around trying out various specializations and has narrowed down to the ones that have the most impact in the surgical field. Along the way, we created many firsts of its kind: first partial amputee prosthetic hand and first kidney tumor case designed in India, First tongue cancer model in the World, etc.In June 2016, She created Anatomiz3D, an offshoot of SAHAS, which catered only to the medical field. In such a short span Anatomiz3D has more than 800 case studies of success to share with the world.She has seen loads of ups and downs, successes and failures all this while, with most things not going the way she imagined, but at such times, she choose to pivot her plans as she always intends to keep moving forward.

Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop.

Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets.

Her employees and freelancers all work from home too as she and they value the freedom and lifestyle this affords. She began and built her company over several years whilst working full time as an Air Traffic Controller. She is focused, dedicated and frantically entrepreneurial. She also has a thirst for learning and passing on her knowledge that perfectly aligns with what Udemy offers.
As an Air Traffic Control Officer for 11 years she was a supervisor, instructor and examiner - guiding new Air Traffic Controllers as they come into the job and then signing them off as suitable to control solo. It was a rewarding experience - especially seeing under-confident new controllers shine and become more qualified themselves. Her calm, no-nonsense instructional delivery was honed during these years in this fast-paced but safety critical training environment.
Due to the stressful nature of the job, Kim started to become extremely interested in self-management of stress, self-improvement and the work-life balance. Over the years she has become passionate about regaining control over our own lives and working out what works for each individual. This is often reflected in her courses, social media channels and products.
Kim's day-to-day involves building websites, creating digital products, books, designing packaging and generally stretching her left brain hemisphere. Her honours degree was in Internet Computer Science and she has kept up to date with many skills and built upon them.

Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets.

I run my own company since April 2015.  	What is the next step?  I've gathered experience by working for several years as a freelancer with a keen focus on handling creative projects ranging from very small businesses to brands and YouTube channels with over 500k subscribers. Now I’m looking forward to sharing my knowledge by creating exciting courses that are easy to follow - and most importantly - USEFUL to you. I am looking to work with forward-thinking people who seek to create something original and catchy that will reinforce their brand and follow their vibe. I’m always committed to providing value while giving away random tips to make your workflow easier, no matter what we work on.    	What are my mission and passion? I believe in making the Web Business and Internet Media world a better place because my actions will affect (and hopefully positively shape) my followers, friends, family, and future generations. Since I live in a small village where people work in agriculture or do physical labor, I set the goal for myself to be a sort of pioneer in the web-based business field, growing myself as a designer every single day.    You can always contact me, as I don't mind talking to anyone about how I might help your business or about what course topics I might record if you like my teaching style.       To your success, Andrew (Andrzej in Polish) ;)Hiện thêmẨn bớt",51%,35%,13%,1%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 2/2025,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,Nghệ thuật sắp chữ động,6 phần,34 bài giảng,2 giờ 3 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/after-effects-liquid-text-animation/

As a drafting/CAD manager and then as the chief architect and product manager of the CADWorx design software I have developed an extensive knowledge of both the practices and procedures and the tools used by the drafting profession. I now bring this expertise to mentor and train the next generation of Computer Aided Designers through Horn Drafting and CAD Center.From 1986 through 2006 I worked as the Drafting Manager for Toromont Energy Systems, a manufacturing firm that designed and built process skids for use in chemical plants and refineries. My staff grew to as many as 25 professional drafter/designers in all disciplines of plant design, for hundreds of projects in the petrochemical and energy sectors. I was responsible for all aspects of the project design including working with staff drafter/designers and engineers to produce the best overall project for the customer. I was also responsible for hiring and mentoring/training new staff members. During these 20 years I learned a great deal about what it takes to be successful in the drafting/design industry, and I look forward to sharing that with my students.In 2006 I became the Business Development and Program Manager for the Intergraph Corporation, overseeing the CADWorx Plant Professional line of software products. CADWorx is the world’s leading AutoCAD-based software that is used to develop 3D models and drawings of process plants worldwide.

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above. This includes a Udemy bestseller course.Neil's courses are aimed at 3D modellers of all levels, with a great number of new tips and tricks for each learner. Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts. This enables absolute beginners and mid-range learners to learn alongside one another, with nothing holding them back, and at different paces, chosen by each student.Professional BackgroundNeil Bettison is a professional 3D artist with 9 years of modelling experience, including assets, characters, and environments. Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests. He is successful on social media and he quickly became a success on YouTube since launching his 3D Tudor channel in 2019. Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets. Neil strives to continuously expand his library of courses over time, aiming to introduce learners to more software and tips and tricks over time.

I'm a multi-passionate online entrepreneur, DIY designer & Holistic Health Strategist teaching small business owners how to efficiently build a brand and business with non-techy and inexpensive tools.
Because I can never sit still and learn new stuff more often than other people have regular bowel movements, I’ve started building other businesses, too.

  
With limited time.

  
(Because I have small kids).

  
And fun and non-nerdy tools.

  
(Because I’m still wearing a tech-onesie myself and don’t intend to ever grow into a full-blown nerd.)

  
Also, my French roots are allergic to over-priced tools and services, which is why I’ve become a Black Belt Master in Free But Effective Biz Tool Kung Fu.

  
(OK, I made up the black belt).

  
I do believe that every small business owner, tiny start-up or passionate kitchen table entrepreneur deserves a chance to grow without having to max-out any credit cards.

  
That’s why I enjoy putting together actionable & high-quality classes at budget-savvy prices.
Since absorbing without implementing is completely useless, I like to keep my lectures short and to the point.
Sing-Along style.So that YOU get results FAST.
I'm also highly-sensitive. This can be a real pain in the ""you know where"", but it also means that I'm not just saying things like:
I'M HERE FOR YOU!
I really am.
Can't wait to see you in our classroom!

My name is Andrzej Pach (but Andrew is easier to say ^^) and I spend my daily time with graphic design, presentations, motion & animation, typography, video editing, and online teaching. Most of my work is done in Adobe After Effects & Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 / 2021 / 365 and Camtasia so naturally, this is the software I want to teach about and share my experience with. I have completed more than 5000 graphic projects for clients, mostly including video animations like intros, outros, and transitions for various YouTube channels & marketers. On Fiverr alone (a freelancing website), I have more than 3500 reviews and 4k+ finished jobs. I would like to share with you the knowledge that I was able to ""stack up"" during the process. I am always willing to help people out by enhancing their brands and projects.    	Who am I?  I'm born in 1989, live in a small village in Poland, and graduated from my University in July 2014. A few years back, when I tried to find my ""place"" after getting hired to prepare a website, flyer, and business card for a local business in my area, I finally ""felt it"". Since then (2011) I have expanded my skills in this area by completing various graphic, website, and design-related projects. Places like the Warrior Forum, freelancing websites, and graphic contests across the web caught my interest and never let me go. I run my own company since April 2015.  	What is the next step?  I've gathered experience by working for several years as a freelancer with a keen focus on handling creative projects ranging from very small businesses to brands and YouTube channels with over 500k subscribers. Now I’m looking forward to sharing my knowledge by creating exciting courses that are easy to follow - and most importantly - USEFUL to you. I am looking to work with forward-thinking people who seek to create something original and catchy that will reinforce their brand and follow their vibe. I’m always committed to providing value while giving away random tips to make your workflow easier, no matter what we work on.    	What are my mission and passion? I believe in making the Web Business and Internet Media world a better place because my actions will affect (and hopefully positively shape) my followers, friends, family, and future generations. Since I live in a small village where people work in agriculture or do physical labor, I set the goal for myself to be a sort of pioneer in the web-based business field, growing myself as a designer every single day.    You can always contact me, as I don't mind talking to anyone about how I might help your business or about what course topics I might record if you like my teaching style.       To your success, Andrew (Andrzej in Polish) ;)Hiện thêmẨn bớt",60%,27%,11%,0%,2%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 2/2025,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Thiết kế,3D & Hoạt hình,Adobe After Effects,6 phần,30 bài giảng,2 giờ 33 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/after-effects-video-transitions/

I graduated from Humboldt State University amid the redwoods of Northern California. After working for Lockheed Missiles and Space for 14 years as an IBM system programmer and Cisco Systems for 12 years as a test engineer, I retired at 48.I instantly became bored.2 Community CollegeIn response to my boredom, I enrolled in Columbia Community College to take writing, art, acting, and statistics classes. I took 24 units over one year and received straight A's.I was still bored.3 Writing and Self-publishingI began writing fiction and nonfiction books and self-publishing them on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Smashwords in July 2011. Though I wrote and published several books, my self-publishing business didn’t take off until my wife joined me.4 My Wife and Author, Melanie JacksonMy wife, Melanie Jackson, was an author who published over two romance novels per year through her New York publisher, Dorchester Press. After publishing 24 novels with Dorchester, the company folded, and Melanie was without a publisher (she wanted to write cozy mysteries anyway).I convinced Melanie to join me in self-publishing cozy mysteries on Amazon.5 The Self-publishing YearsFor the last 14 years, from July 2011 until now (2/15/2025), my wife and I have written and self-published cozy mysteries. At first, we continued to self-publish on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Smashwords, but eventually chose to self-publish exclusively on Amazon. I've self-published well over 100 of my wife’s books on Amazon.During the last 14 years, from 2011 until now (2/15/2025), my wife and I have made precisely $501,711.89 self-publishing books on Amazon alone.6 My Wife and IWhen I say “my wife and I,” I mean that my wife did the writing, and I helped with the brainstorming, did half the editing, created the book covers, and self-published and marketed my wife’s books. So, my wife had it pretty good while I honed my writing, self-publishing and marketing skills.After about five years of self-publishing a book every two months, Melanie and I burned out and slowed way, waaayyy, doowwwnnn…7 UdemyI began publishing courses on Udemy, Skillshare and multiple other sites in July 2014, focusing on writing, self-publishing and book covers.

He is a professional prop and environment artist. Neil is a successful instructor with over 200,000 students cross-platform. His courses are among the highest-rated for 3D modelling on Udemy, with reviewer ratings at 4.7 or above.

Each course is different, with most common themes including medieval England Tudor game assets and buildings, or sci-fi scenes and weapons. Neil's instructor style makes him stand out because of his to-the-point instructions and clear guidance. He is the only instructor on Udemy who uses live on-screen tooltips throughout his lessons, helping learners to follow along, without the need to go back and revisit previous shortcuts.

Neil initially got started with 3D modelling because of his passion for gaming. Some of his first models included creating assets for City Skylines workshop. After attending the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) for a BA(Hons) Computer Games Arts degree, Neil began freelancing. As a freelancer, Neil expanded his portfolio through work on historical assets and environment, working to sell these models alongside custom work requests.

Neil's YouTube channel has become a go-to for all Blender students and hobbyists alike. Following his success on YouTube, Neil went on to create Blender courses on Udemy, aiming to synchronise them with his free YouTube content so that students can get the most out of learning. Neil's 3D models are made using a combination of Blender, Maya, and ZBrush - depending on their specifications. Neil uses Blender for particle effects and complex asset animation. Neil can use two popular game engines, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and Unity, with many years of experience in using both. He is proficient in Photoshop and uses this tool for his textures and the original concept art he produces as part of his 3D model research workflow. Neil uses Substance Painter but also makes his own materials and textures using Substance Designer. Neil prefers using Topogun for retopology, specialising in optimising retopology for AAA assets.

designer. He purchased a lot of books and watched seminars and make friends
with great designers. He put his energy and concentration on how to produce a
good designs and how to have a good relationship with clients.

1843,Introduction to Islamic Geometric Design,Learn how to understand and make Islamic geometric patterns,Xếp hạng cao nhất,"Xếp hạng cao nhấtXếp hạng: 4,6/54,6 (708 xếp hạng)3.429 học viên","Eric BrougExpert and author on Islamic Geometric Design4,6 xếp hạng giảng viên708 đánh giá3429 học viên1 khóa học  	    I'm a leading expert on Islamic geometric design. I've published three popular books on the subject, that have sold over 30,000 copies worldwide and are available in English, French, Farsi, Turkish and Dutch.  
  	 I feel passionate about reviving the spirit of creative innovation and excellence that characterises the art and architecture of, for example, the Mamluk, Ghurid and Seljuk eras.  For craftsmen in these eras, it was not enough to recreate a composition, they instead made new compositions, they innovated and took Islamic geometric design to a new level. Through my books and workshops, I try to make a contribution to the revival of such a creative attitude to this subject.  
  	  My passion for Islamic Geometric Design started when I was living in Amsterdam in my early twenties. The initial appeal for me of Islamic geometric design was that it offered scope for creativity, for learning, and for historical study. I committed myself to Islamic geometric design and 25 years later, I still am equally committed to it. After ten years in Amsterdam of teaching myself this subject, I moved to London to study at the Prince's School of Traditional Arts and later at SOAS. My focus has changed since I moved to the UK: I am now especially interested in teaching this subject using the same approach craftsmen have used for centuries: with a pair of compasses and a ruler. Traditional craftsmen didn't calculate angles to make their geometrical compositions, they weren't mathematicians. Nevertheless, they were able to make very complex compositions with just these two tools. This fascinates me because it means we can also learn how to make Islamic geometric patterns without calculations and with only a pair of compasses and a ruler.  
  	  Even though I have been dedicated to this subject every day for the last twenty years, it is still sometimes a source of wonder to me that this is what I am doing. This feeling has only grown the last few years since I had the exceptional privilege to write my second book. I hope to write more books and to do more teaching.  
  	   My books:  
 Islamic Geometric Patterns (Book and CD), Thames & Hudson 2008 
  	  This small book shows how to make around twenty different patterns using just a pair of compasses, a pencil and a ruler. The patterns are categorised according to their level of complexity. Each pattern is linked to a building or art object that features that particular pattern. It's been translated into Farsi and Turkish and has sold over 25,000 copies. It has been the bestselling Islamic artbook in in 2012 and 2013.  
 Islamic Geometric Design , Thames & Hudson, 2013 
  	The first large and comprehensive art book on this subject. It has over 800 illustrations, with many photos of buildings never before published. It gives a great deal of historical information as well as practical analysis of many of the compositions. It is also available in a French edition. It features an appendix that shows how to make over a dozen patterns, using the same methodology as in my first book.  Islamic Design Workbook, Thames & Hudson 2016
Like an adult colouring book but more fun, more challenging and more educational. It features 48 different patterns, categorised by region and complexity. Each pattern has a corresponding loose-leaf page which has pre-printed construction lines. The challenge is to figure out what sections of lines to trace and which sections to ignore, in order to create the pattern.

Regarding the audiophile part of me, I started to intensely study this area since several years ago. It’s difficult to get a college degree in this field, since there are only a few universities around the world which have this specialization (from what I know, In Europe, there is a famous one in Denmark, and another in UK). The closest specialization would be electrical engineering, but I wanted something a bit more specific. So instead of going abroad for studies, I decided to study at home in my free time.

Hopefully, the courses I’m about to publish, will save you from this ordeal and give you concentrated and easy to digest information.
