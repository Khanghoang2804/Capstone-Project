I left my job and went full-time online in 2001. Teaching here on Udemy is probably the most satisfying thing I do. Being able to help others to learn life-changing techniques and business models.Over the last 15 years or so, I've created and marketed many digital e-learning products and have also worked extensively in blogging and affiliate marketing.I have always preferred to have multiple business interests, so I started selling on Amazon in the spring of 2013.  Previous to that, I had never sold any physical products online. Today I also run my own independent e-commerce websites.I'm still an affiliate marketer. However, I always wanted to sell my own products too, and Amazon was the obvious place to get started.Starting on Amazon without the guidance of an experienced seller can be tough, and the courses I took myself were not complete and were missing certain vital parts of the 'puzzle.' I learned more through trial and error than anything else, and that's what prompted me to create a step-by-step blueprint to success on Amazon.A year after starting on Amazon, I set up my independent e-commerce store to build an asset that was my own and could potentially be sold in the future.Sometimes I get asked how I manage to get so much done. It's simply a case of organization and prioritizing (is that a word? Anyway, I'm sure you know what I mean!). Obviously, I don't do it all myself, and I now have full-time and part-time assistants. However, when I first started, I had nobody.

I'm a 30-year veteran copywriter who has been teaching people how to write persuasively since 1989.Through my conference workshops, copywriting classes, telephone seminars, webinars, trade journal articles, newsletters, blog posts and in my many books, I have helped thousands of copywriters on four continents master the craft of persuading on paper and in pixels.I taught myself the craft of advertising copywriting, and worked as a freelance copywriter as well as a senior copywriter for two advertising agencies. I sold everything from pump parts to utility trailers to digital video transmission systems and insurance services, working in every media. I even helped a client use direct mail to sell a coffee table book about Elvis Presley. Don't ask.After working for a decade as a copywriter, I narrowed my focus to two specialties: writing direct mail letters for businesses, and fundraising letters for non-profits.Now I'd like to help you write copy that gets noticed, gets read, and gets results.

Business Podcast Host.4,5 xếp hạng giảng viên2247 đánh giá7416 học viên1 khóa họcHey there! I’m Nathan. I’m a founder who recently sold my company after hitting a valuation of $10.5 million, closing 10,000 paying customers, and hitting $5m in sales deposited in my bank, all when I was just 26 years old. 
Today, I focus on interviewing CEO’s on my podcast The Top Entrepreneurs, which just passed 5,000,000 downloads and was named a top business podcast by INC. 
I also buy and sell companies and record the process for my show Instant Investor on my Facebook fan page. Episode 1 got 1.2 million views. Most recently I acquired TheTopInbox and eTools and am applying what I know about digital marketing to 3-5x their revenue. 
I just signed a major book deal with Portfolio Random House (many say the largest for a first time, 27 year old author!) so I’m spending a lot of time writing stories about growing companies, founders creating wealth for themselves, and how to use digital marketing to scale companies without spending lots of money. 
I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out the best way to teach highly effective tactics to teams, students, and my own employees at scale. Over the 6 years I build my company, I took daily notes on tactics I used that worked, and ones I wasted loads of energy on testing. I give you all the shortcuts for the first time ever (exclusive to Udemy) in my new course, The Ultimate Digital Marketing Bootcamp.
Now that you know about me, feel free to tell me about yourself on twitter @nathanlatka.

Since then, my team and I have consulted with over 450 companies around the world.
I started my career as an artist, but soon transitioned into the world of online marketing. I saw so many businesses being outmaneuvered by their competition, only because they didn't understand the nuances and strategies behind a successful online marketing campaign. 
I have a Masters Degree in Industrial Psychology from Hofstra University, which has helped me shape our agency and grow our business portfolio.
I decided to  AdVenture Media Group to help smaller companies compete with advertisers with internal marketing teams and huge advertising budgets.
Since 2011, I've helped both small, local boutiques and publicly traded enterprises increase their online sales through smarter online advertising campaigns. Our team has managed ad campaigns spending anywhere from $2,000 / mo to millions of dollars a year. 
I've generated millions of dollars in revenue for my clients, spanning more than 75 unique industries. Online marketing is complex, but with the right tools and guidance, you'll be absolutely amazed how easy, fun and effective it can be,My beginners guide to Google AdWords has been watched by over 900,000 students and I've been teaching Google AdWords, Google Analytics and Web Design since 2012.

What I noticed was, that t-shirt with low quality pictures were sold much cheaper than same t-shirt with glossy images. So I started buying these underpriced products, taking new pictures and reselling them for profits. That was the first time I realised, that people really judge book by its cover.
After graduating from Business School (Poland&Australia) I started my career as a marketing manager of newly created precious metal company - Bessergold - and took it from scratch to 7 figures business within less than one year.
I didn’t like the idea of trading metals for the rest of my life, so I decided to pursue my real passion - building new brands. I started with my family casket manufacturing business (yes, these caskets) - Piechota Coffins - and turned it into No. 1 premium brand on the local market - see my portfolio for details.
Currently, I work as a freelance brand consultant for companies across Europe with strong focus on small businesses and startups. If not working, I travel the world with backpack and my lovely girlfriend.

He loved to sell on eBay as a side hustle. However he realised that paying the eBay commission fees was a huge pain. Keeping inventory in a small house was no better. So instead of paying eBay every time he sold an item, he made his own website where he could list all his items without paying commission.He noticed though that people were not buying his products, so as you would he started to google ""How to get people to see my website in google"", coincidently he stumbled upon SEO.Since then, he dived deep into learning the ins and outs of SEO where he decided to put this skill into good use. He started to create websites for local businesses in his area to help them generate more customers. In 2016, he stumbled upon the business model ""Rank & Rent"". He then asked his local businesses whether they would like to continue this 'advertising' for their company. It was the day where he received his first pay check from this business model. Since then, he has built many Rank & Rent sites that has allowed him to generate his income passively. Generating an income that is hands-off, he now uses his time to share his knowledge and his expertise with others. He enjoys the thrill in having his own time.My favourite quote - ""Life can take you to some weird places, but sometimes that is good, sometimes you need to get out of your comfort zone to become someone great"".Hiện thêmẨn bớt",72%,23%,4%,1%,< 1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 1/2024,409.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Hack tăng trưởng,Thu nhập thụ động,14 phần,86 bài giảng,9 giờ 6 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/rank-and-rent-local-lead-generation/

He attended UCLA college and majored in Computer Information Systems and Business Marketing. Kent worked as an Account Executive at an Investment Banking firm from 2006-2009. Bored with his career choice, in late 2009 he went back to school and took a crash course in Graphic Design and Computer Programming. In April 2010, he launched his first website at Read2Learn which encourages people to read books to learn new skills.He tries to read at least one book per week. He used to be one of those people who would never pick up a book because he thought they were boring. 
Everything changed when he discovered ""How To.."" books on Amazon which he finds very interesting. Now he's officially a book nerd, and he's always learning something new.Based on his experience, he's believes that anyone can learn how to do anything if they truly have the desire to learn and succeed. With so much mis-information being passed around the internet, Kent Mauresmo teamed up with Anastasiya Petrova (another book junkie) and decided to write their own books.Kent and Ana's books are created out of frustration. Simply put, they've had to read countless blog, countless books, and have watched countless videos to find solutions to their problems.
They simplify everything that they learn from multiple sources, and then combine the most useful information in their books to help save people time.Their first book entitled,""How To Build a Website With WordPress...Fast!"" was released February 20, 2012 and became a best seller within the first 30 days.Their second book entitled,""SEO For WordPress..Beginners Guide"" was released May 30, 2012.

I coach authors and writers how to write their books in such a way that THEY BENEFIT even when they give their books away.How is that possible? It's actually pretty easy, barely an inconvenience. Authors should be including 'calls-to-action' and access to additional content within their books to incentivize readers to visit their websites and collect email addresses.They should also include links to their social media profiles within their books.And they should also use their websites to give away sample chapters (or other types of digital lead magnets) to collect email addresses and build a valuable email list of interested readers and prospective customers. You want to get your book into as many people's hands as possible and, if you're a new author, giving away books can be a lot easier than selling books.I teach my clients about the 80/20 rule of book marketing this way:Give away 1,000 books (these can be digital so no cost).20% of those people (200) will JOIN your email list.20% of those people (40) will BUY SOMETHING from you (physical book, online course, membership, webinar training, etc.).20% of those people (8) will BUY WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE SELLING such as coaching or consulting.To find these EIGHT CLIENTS, you give away 1,000 books. Since 2011, I've sold hundreds of thousands of books and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties exclusively as a self-published author.Leveraging self-published books is easily the most powerful thing you can do for your business today.Where else can you have a physical product available for sale on the world's largest and most trusted marketplace and, when it sells, Amazon will literally do ALL OF THE WORK and send you a royalty check every month?Hiện thêmẨn bớt",87%,13%,0%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 11/2024,589.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing kỹ thuật số,Thiết kế web,8 phần,32 bài giảng,5 giờ 12 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/freepage/

After being a full-time CPA marketer for more than 5 years, I decided to shift gears and use my skills to build companies.Ever since, I have been lucky enough to do what I love the most: entrepreneurship, travelling the world, pushing my comfort zone and discovering things that I couldn't learn in the classroom.One year ago, I decided to take the next step and share my knowledge with those who are ready to start their own business. This decision brought me to Udemy, where I am able to combine my biggest talents: entrepreneurship, marketing and teaching. My teaching philosophy on Udemy is simple: I am crafting trainings that I wish I had available to me when I started my first company. My courses serve a very important goal: helping you to transform your life and becoming a successful entrepreneur and marketer. I've seen the impact a solid business can have on someone's life.

Ed’s student's number in the thousands, both in the corporate arena, as well as in Post-Secondary Academia. Ed has a passion to help and lead the transforming of I.T. communities from the traditional failing development cultures of the past to the successes achieved from a philosophy of “Agile Thinking.”As a multifaceted public speaker, presenter, educator and corporate mentor in a number of diverse arena’s, bridging the generations from the Y/Millennials to the Gen X’ers right up to the Boomers, Ed’s passion is to see success and excellence again become part of what we have lost in our current organizational cultures.Ed trains professionals in the University environment on a nightly basis. These are the professional practitioners who are adding to their already learned skills and are now focused on improving their product development and leadership abilities. While doing that on a nightly basis, Ed works with his own Management Consulting practice in giving back to a new corporate culture by day. Ed’s focus in both Corporate Canada and Academia is to help I.T. practitioners and their organizations increase Software Development success rates by refining/redefining their software/product development processes.For organizations not able to transform into an “Agile” way of thinking quickly, Ed works with them and evaluates, recommends, and implements techniques that strategically allow them to shift to an Agile culture in a more subtle way that fits into their highly structured and constrained cultures. Whether implemented quickly or done more slowly, change is essential if we are to grow and succeed in the complex business arena of today.Ed loves interacting with his audiences when he is sharing his knowledge and his understanding of the “Agile Space.” His in-depth knowledge gives him the experiences to share that many times override “textbook theory.” Real-life always trumps theory.

I teach them the skills to create a captivating online presence without frustration, tech overwhelm or breaking the bank.I am a freelancer in the digital marketing space with a small client base. My journey with Google My Business (as it was then known as) started in 2016, when I built a website for a cabinetmaker. His business had been around for a couple of years, and he requested my help in marketing his business. As with most small businesses, his marketing budget was tight, so advertising was not an option. That was when I discovered Google My Business, now known as Google Business Profile.I was hooked. Being fascinated by what this free online listing service provided by Google could offer, I became obsessed with discovering more about GMB. I subscribed to newsletters and blogs from Local SEO experts, participated in webinars, watched videos, and absorbed all available information on the topic. There were no official courses available at the time, so my knowledge and experience comes from trial and error. It took a couple of months for my cabinetmaker to rank in the 3-Pack and his business has grown beyond his wildest dreams. He is inundated with calls and has had to employ staff to help him with the increased workload.Once I proved to myself and especially my client, that Google Business Profile does work, I was delighted. Since then, all the clients I have helped with optimising their profile rank in the 3-Pack.I decided to become a Local SEO Course Instructor after talking to many local business owners who can't afford to advertise or an SEO consultant to enhance their online presence. From my experience, I know that any business owner can optimise their Google Business Profile themselves. All it takes is motivation and the willingness to set time aside to do so. In other words, going the extra mile and in so doing they can feature on the first page of local search as it is lonely on the extra mile as so few business owners have taken the time to do so.In my first course, Rank in the Google 3-Pack and Dominate Local Search Results, I walk you through all the steps to success.My introductory course, ""Dominating Local Search with Google's 3-Pack,"" will teach you all the steps you need to succeed in boosting your online presence. While I wouldn't claim to be an expert myself, I have learned from numerous local SEO experts from around the world, which has resulted in the development of my own method to optimise Google Business Profiles for optimal results.Whilst I primarily created this course for local business owners, it is also a very good course for those who would like to earn an online income providing GBP Management Service to local businesses. The market is huge, and income potential income is very lucrative.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",67%,33%,0%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 7/2024,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing kỹ thuật số,SEO cục bộ,7 phần,21 bài giảng,1 giờ 30 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-budget-friendly-1-page-website-for-local-businesses/

When this occurs we sometimes notice things that we would normally miss or dismiss as trivial.This is a story about going from struggle to clarity and how it can happen in one moment.The Struggle PeriodThat period when we are struggling can be so dark and stressful. You just don’t know what you are doing wrong. Even if you have a good day, its not consistent….I used to wonder what are these successful people doing so easily, why cant I do it?When I started online, I never really found anyone that could help me. I got myself in a state where I was getting worried about my mental health. I will never forget that time when I needed help. I wished that somebody could have shown me the way. Fortunately I worked everything out, but I promised myself that, in future I would lend a helping hand to those people struggling to build a business online.For Years I Struggled OnlineDebts Were MountingSo Was Stress At HomeI Had Desire And BeliefBut Nothing Was WorkingI Couldn’t Afford To fix My Car So I Had To Carry Water Bottles In Case It OverheatedMy kids saw this to, so I felt so ashamed to be in such a pathetic state.I Spent My Last $5000 On A Marketing Course That Guaranteed That It Was Going To Be The SolutionIt Didn’t WorkI was at a low point.I Started To Battle Negative Thoughts“I Am A Complete Failure”People Started To Worry About Me“I Was Extremely Depressed”I Did Something I Never DoAfter a sleepless night, I looked at My Clock, It Was 4AM“I Needed To Get Out Of Here”I put my sneakers on and just walked the streetsI Walked And Walked For 4 Hours.I Started To Feel A Sense Of CalmI Had Been Over ThinkingNo Guru IS The AnswerI Am Going To Keep It Very SimpleThe word Value kept popping into my head, then I remember a very random line from a long deceased sales trainer by the name of Zig Ziglar.It was pretty weird and completely random. I had no interest in Zig Ziglar and never thought about him on a day to day basis. I have to include it, because it is exactly how it happened, This completely random quote from a long deceased sales trainer popped in my head.You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want..I remember being a bit puzzled by this advice when I first heard it in an old training manual.I mean it sounded good, but I really had no idea what it meant or how to implement it.Sometimes we receive wisdom before we are ready. Your brain files it away until you find a few more pieces. All of a sudden, I could not stop thinking about that quote.You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want.. Wow. This random quote was exactly what I needed to hear. But, I didn’t just hear it, I understood.Value, Value I kept repeating.Ok this is where it gets a little weird, I don't know if I believe in signs from the universe or fate. But the following moment which I will tell you about, combined with the first revelation about Zig Ziglar’s quote would make this walk one of the most significant events of my life. I know I sound like a crazy person, but that’s ok.I will never forget.As I walked I could see something pink tied to a light pole.As I got closer, I could see it was an advertisement, it was like a word search puzzle with letters and numbers. You know like a square grid with numbers and letters and you have to try and read the words inside.It was bizarre. I stood there staring at it for 20 minutes. I must have looked like a lunatic staring at a light pole at 4 am in the morningI could read some words.It said Curious about ending emotional eating. Don’t feed the frustration by over eating and then it had a phone number, it must have been a weight loss company or something. I never called them because weight was not really my issue. Don’t get distracted by the topic, I was just obsessed with how they delivered the message and how it really hooked me in.I thought it was the most genius advertisement that I had ever seen. I have never walked up to an advertisement so utterly curious before. It also stirred up emotion in me as I thought about my own feelings of frustration.Curious, that lingered in my mind. Curious is also the first word in the ad.I am staring at this message because it made me curious…I mean talk about light bulb moments. I knew then that I needed to incorporate curiosity into what I am doing. Like into my marketing. I want to make people stop and stare like crazy people. Once I had their attention, they would see the value in what I offered.I Re-Engineered Everything whilst I walked in the darkness. It was almost a spiritual experience. It was like I had all these puzzle pieces so close to being in the right spot. All of the sudden all the pieces came together. Have you ever had one of those clarity moments, where suddenly you see things perfectly clear. Your brain is on fire….Going on dawn walks is so important to me to this day.I imagined myself carrying these Christmas sacks that had the big words VALUE on them. I started handing them out to people. Once again, yes I sound crazy, I realize this.This was a signValue – I need to do more for people and I decided that I didnt want anything in returnValue and Curiosity. As I walked I kept repeating those 2 words. A week later I began to study copywriting.Copywriting became like a secret super power. I used to write really stupid text down in a clumsy attempt to get sales.Good sales copy is on a whole other level. It plugs into deep emotions. But before it does that it makes use of powerful curiosity to make people look and read the offer.I will give you a quick rundown on how effective sales copy looksWhen you create an offer it could be for an ad or just for an email, for anything. Instead of writing some clueless ramble, I began using copywriting formulas, like Problem Agitate Solution. PAS, its focuses on emotions and curiosity which is the most powerful way to sell somethingFor exampleSay I was a Life Coach I wouldnt say ” I am a life coach I can make you happy and successful”I would talk about P… Problem, frustration, Self Doubt, Feeling helplessI would make you feel these feelings that you already have.Then I would Agitate and stir up the emotion to the point where it almost hurts. Lets feel that pain and let the reader feel that pain. We are not creating a new pain, we are encouraging them to really feel one that they have been carrying for some time. Only our ideal prospects have these feelings of frustration. We have the product that will eliminate the pain.Next comes S for Solve. We provide a solution to the problem that is causing the pain.This is just a brief example, but these techniques are incredibly effective. Most good marketers are using them without telling you.I would never have learned about copywriting if I hadn’t seen that weird pink ad. It made me focus on curiosity which was the missing piece that led me to learning more.Can you imagine how much more stuff you would sell, or affiliate products you would sell, or software you would sell if you knew how to harness curiosity and emotional copywriting techniques. The product doesn’t matter, it’s all about know what your prospect feels and letting them know that you can fix it. Its all about emotions and curiosity. Curiosity is to make them look, like in the heading or the weird pink word puzzle which made me stop in my tracks for 20 minutes.Value Curiosity CopywritingThat was my mantra.I just needed to put it all together.In my head I started to build a lead funnel.It was going to have value, curiosity and copywritingI start to think about stacking a lot of value up front. I wanted people to feel as though they ripped me off not the other way round. Like whatever I sold I wanted the customer to feel that they won. They got far more value than what they paid.I thought, “what would happen if I made the price low?”I would sell plenty, but I said to myself, I would only cover my advertising costs and make no profitsCover my advertising costs….Cover my advertising costs. Wait a minute, I GOT ITI stopped dead in my tracks, I thought that I had a problem. If I built a sales funnel that covered my advertising costs, I do NOT have a problem, I have the biggest breakthrough of my career.All I need to do was make profit on the back end with higher ticket, higher value products.Like A Low-Mid-High Price SequenceI Decided To Try Out My New TechniqueBack then I was selling affiliate offers.I messaged a prospect out of the blue. This guy was an influencer. I really wanted to sign him up for my affiliate offer. He could make me THOUSANDS FAST But I Refused to Give Him My Affiliate Link That is what I usually would do and nearly always got me ignoredI wanted to try the curiosity angle firstWould I be Ignored Like Usual Or Would I Get His FULL AttentionI sent him a funny picture. It was a dachshund (weiner dog) wearing sunglasses and a hoody sweater.""This is Snoop Dog"", I wrote.""LOL"" was his replySomething Very different happenedThis Guy Eventually Joined My Program As A Sub- Affiliate (he asked for my link)My Phone Started To Go CrazyDing, Ding, DingMore Things Started To Happen As I Continued With My New StrategyI Started Getting SalesI Started Getting Thousands Of Subscribers On YoutubeI Started Getting Thousands Join My Email ListI was using the Value Curiosity Copywriting approachI structured all my paid campaigns in a way that always covered my advertising costs.

And now, you can learn from me as well!Get started by enrolling in my courses, learning new skills and knowledge, and asking me questions in the courses and forums.My Three-Part Qualifications to Teach You (Professional Experience, Education, and Experience Teaching):By combining my professional in-the-field experience (both full-time and freelance), formal education, and experience teaching these topics, I've been able to produce top-notch courses that maximize learning and enable students to become better graphic designers, logo designers, photo editors, artists, and digital media producers.Real World, Professional Experience:I've worked as Webmaster and Advertising Designer at a regional newspaper (The News Chief), Internet Development Director at an award-winning advertising design firm, Technology Librarian at a city library system, and Managing Editor at two international graphic design magazines at Kelby Media Group. I've also written for print and online publications and designed websites and other promotional design work for clients on an on-going basis for the past 20 years.Education:Besides relevant marketplace experience, I also have a B.A. in Communication from Southeastern University, an M.A. in Journalism and Media Studies from the University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, and a Ph.D. in Communication from Regent University. My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on the mythic branding of Apple's Macintosh/Mac in their primary commercial campaigns (1984, Think Different, Switch/Real People, and Get a Mac). Example graduate courses such as Creative Approaches to Digital Media and Visual Storytelling have helped me when developing my own courses. Experience Teaching:Teaching these topics in the classroom and online has helped me figure out the best ways to explain concepts and guide students in the designs and productions. Besides being a full-time professor, I've developed curriculum and taught design, photography, and digital media courses for years at the university level for various schools in Florida, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Sorrento (Italy).Courses:I'm the founder of Good Creative Academy, the premiere online school for learning and creating. If you're looking to learn more about graphic design, photo retouching, visual art, Adobe software, and digital media production, you have arrived at the right place.Fun tech-related facts about me:I taught myself QBasic when I was 13, and later used that programming language to write a program that simulated the DOS prompt, to fool my high school graphic design teacher into thinking the computers had been hacked.I used web banner advertising on my websites in high school and during my freshman year of college, which brought in about $750 a month in income.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",47%,34%,13%,3%,3%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 11/2019,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing trên mạng xã hội,Marketing trên mạng xã hội,8 phần,45 bài giảng,4 giờ 40 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/social-media-marketing-science/

My expertise lies in lead generation, conversion optimization, and content marketing – essentially, I help businesses find their people and turn interest into action.Over the years, I've developed a methodical approach to marketing challenges.

Marketing is constantly evolving, and that's what keeps me engaged. What worked brilliantly in 2015 might fall flat today, so I'm always learning and adjusting my approaches.

I was SO excited about the possibility of working online but I was really struggling with the lack of honest, authentic, and high-quality information out there for beginners. So before I even began working in this world, I knew one day I'd want to create the kind of high-quality resources for aspiring marketers that I felt were missing in this space.Why my coursesMy online skills have led to working with an exciting range of talented people, from sole traders to multi-million dollar businesses. And in addition to working as a freelancer, I've also worked in a digital marketing agency and an in-house corporate role. With this wide range of hands-on experiences, I am now able to teach impactful marketing courses designed with other creative overachievers in mind. So you can feel confident that my courses are made by someone who knows exactly how intimidating it can be to be trying to master 20 tools at once and stay on top of constant updates with each of them. And I hope to take away some of the overwhelm and make you feel like you're not alone in this.Why I love what I do:I'm originally from Slovakia, spent 10 years living in Canada, lived out of a backpack for a few years while working as a tour guide in Europe and have now been living in Australia since 2015. And my dream was always to be able to not be attached to physical office space and I'm so happy to say that becoming a freelancer has allowed me to continue my happy nomadic life and take my work with me to amazing places like Bali, Thailand, Cambodia and others.But since becoming a mom in 2023, my vision of 'freedom' looks a little less like laptops on a beach and a lot more like just getting to spend more time on the things (and people) that matter the most. (Though to be honest, we flew with my son three times before he was seven months old, so travel is still a huge part of my life.)Where you come in:Now, my ultimate goal is to continuously keep improving as an instructor, empowering you to be excited about your future in the digital world, having learned valuable new skills within this exciting world of online marketing. :)I couldn't live the life I live and do what I love to do every day without you, so from the bottom of my heart thank you for being here and giving me your valuable time - I can't wait to see you in my courses!Hiện thêmẨn bớt",70%,24%,4%,1%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 4/2025,959.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing trên mạng xã hội,Marketing trên Instagram,7 phần,24 bài giảng,3 giờ 16 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/instagram-reels-in-canva/

Along with this, having a degree in Computer Science has given me a strong analytical mind for dealing with complex problems. Through these two disciplines I create a unique blend of efficiency and creativity. I believe anyone can become a designer or programmer. All it takes is practice. 
I am also a world traveler and have lived in and learned from many different countries. During a 6 month stay in Japan, I became fascinated with their people's drive and craftsmanship. I try to incorporate that same level of energy, passion and detail-oriented work as much as possible in to my own life.
Being self-taught in many of my endeavors, I know how important it is to have high quality content. I learned most of my Adobe skills through countless hours of YouTube videos by the greats like FreddieW and Andrew Kramer. I decided to start giving back to the community that helped me so much, and created my YouTube Channel, AdobeMasters. Through this YouTube channel, I am able to create tutorials for anyone who wants to teach themselves these amazing products, just like I wanted to so many years ago. 
This is only the beginning. I want to continue expanding my network  and providing more world-class skill building resources to anyone who wants it. I know I can help you learn the skills you want as fast and efficiently as possible. 
So why not start now? Your dreams won’t get any closer by just thinking about them, take the plunge and I will help guide you to success.

He always loved cars and he also loved talking about cars. A car dealership looked like the perfect place to bring those elements together. As a marketing professional, he was intrigued by the relationship most of us have with cars. Working as a salesperson on the dealership floor, he started to learn first-hand how the glamour and the reality were often in opposition.It seemed clear that people love cars and people love to shop but they do not love to shop for cars. He soon discovered that the way dealerships and car sales people are generally trained to conduct business was a lot different than what he had been used to in the corporate world. He soon developed a different approach with customers that was based on the philosophy that an educated buyer is an easier customer to work with. This is how he built a solid base of customers who appreciated his approach.At the same time, the internet and social media were providing more tools for car buyers to begin to level the playing field. Unfortunately, the industry is still populated by a significant percentage of “old school” thinking in an increasingly competitive industry. The result is that despite some improvements in some quarters, it is still likely that the average car buyer will be subject to a wide range of deceptive practices and “smoke and mirrors” techniques when visiting a dealership.Gordon Wright first pioneered a New Way to Buy a Car in the way he conducted business in the showroom and online. He realized that his methods worked better than the “old school” tactics employed by many of his colleagues and was rewarded with many repeat customers and referrals. Educated customers, he found, were happy customers and were eager to spread the word. His Udemy courses started out as a way to provide the insights needed by car buyers to navigate the car buying but more recently have focused on the selling process. Let’s face it, buying a car should be an enjoyable experience for both the buyer and the seller. Gordon pulls back the curtain giving car buyers the tools they need to get what they want from the process and car sellers get insights into the new, digital age car buyer that make it easier to re-structure the traditional selling process into a means of creating customers for life.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",83%,0%,17%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 1/2023,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Hack tăng trưởng,Kỹ năng bán hàng,7 phần,54 bài giảng,1 giờ 54 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/5o-steps-to-showroom-mastery/

It was no longer material aspirations though.It had something to do with my reason of existence.I felt like a burden on the planet - simply breathing & not living!Why am I alive? Why I exist in the first place?Thought like those shook me deeply. I went into self-talk mode for months & couple of years.This was level 4 and it was really going tough for me & my family.Though for the world, I was super successful, some people even think – I have a fairy tale story, but deep inside, I felt a void which I could not express or explain or voice it out freely ( feared being judged and written off)Some soul searching led to intersection of my Passion, Purpose & Products1.

Every course I teach is delivered through my experience, strength, and hope for you. You get to see both my successes and failures which gives you the ability to copy what I do that works and skip the pain of making the same mistakes.In 2013, just as I was in my final year of high school, I started to develop a burning desire to become financially independent from my parents. I did a lot of mistakes and seemingly everything I put my hands on in the online business world failed. It took me two years to understand the big picture of online marketing so that finally in 2015 I started to be profitable with my online business. In 2016 I decided to take all my knowledge and experience and hand it out to people all around the world who share the same desire to be financially independent. Now you are here with me as proof that somehow out of all that failure, I am still here and things are going well! I am grateful to use the same methods to learn that Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and most of the world's greatest geniuses speak of when asked how they made their great discoveries. The short version is that I focus on maintaining an attitude of gratitude one day at a time and having a silent mind. The purpose of sharing this with you is to show that anything is possible for you in your life today when you are open to receiving the help that is right in front you! My Udemy courses are here in front of you now and they might have every single thing you have been looking for.What experience gives me the ability to be your teacher today?Living one day at a time, doing the next right thing, and asking for help allow me to live by example today. This makes teaching easy for me because I just explain to you what I do that works and what went wrong in the past.Being raised by loving family, friends, costudents, and people online just like you. As a 23-year old student of life I grew up with the internet and know the do's and don'ts of this digital space. I will do my absolute best to make it as easy as it can be to show and explain how you can capitalise on the dot com space.                                                         Who am I?I am a passionate entrepreneur, teacher and filmmaker and have been in the online marketing business for more than 3 years. During that tme I learned a lot through trial and error and got to know the do's and don'ts one needs to consider when it comes to making an income online.I really hope that you will learn a ton from my courses and that you recommend them to friends and family if you see results for yourself :)I would like to educate other people on how to generate an income online, in hopes to better their lives and the people around them.The biggest thing I would like to accomplish on here would be to help as many people as possible by teaching them my secrets so that they can live life on their terms.If you have any questions please do not hesitate to message me directly or connect with me on facebook.Looking forward to your success story :)Your friend and mentorGreg         ➲ How may I help you today? Try one of my courses today to find out.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",41%,38%,16%,3%,2%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 8/2019,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing liên kết,Marketing liên kết,5 phần,11 bài giảng,49 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/make-money-with-affiliate-marketing/

With video they can position themselves as the authority in their niche so they can make a difference, get the clients that they want to work with and find the freedom they always wanted while having fun doing it.”   Vitoria Castro has been an Online Video Expert for over 4 years, entrepreneur and business mentor.     	                      In a former life, Vitoria majored in Visual Arts, and specialized in Interior Design and was approved by one of the top Universities in Brazil for her Masters Degree in Photography, where she  started a carrier as a Photography instructor at the university – working her way to becoming a full professor.     	                      Eventually Vitoria visited USA for vacation and fell in love with the people and its amazing, well organized culture.     	                      It was then that she promised herself that one day she would come back to the US at least to learn the language and participate in the culture. She did! and Since then, she never went back to Brazil except to visit her family.    She started her on online adventures and found her strength was in video marketing and web design and tying the whole process together. Over the 3 years in the field she has created products and services that help people overcome their challenges with video and help them take a holistic approach to their online presence with video as the centerpiece.     	                      Having Portuguese as her native language, she had a huge challenge of not knowing English enough to be on camera and says her first very short one minute video was so bad that she didn’t have the courage to even upload it to YouTube.    Even having that passion for video, knowing that she could overcome any fears she says that the pain of turning pushing the record button was petrifying.  Once again she made a promise to herself: that after that phase of struggle was gone that she would set out to inspire others.    	                      Today, Vitoria is a video expert to those who have been struggling too long to get their business marketing videos up and online and their message out to the world. She says: “Believe me, if I did it with my fears and strong accent, you can do it too!”    Here she is now. After being the expert on online video marketing, teaching, caring and inspiring others, now she is headed to share and help women entrepreneurs not just with video, but also with the “marketing combo” that so many women need help with.     	Vitoria now offers different services and mentorship to entrepreneurs whom want to take their businesses to the next level by combining marketing strategies to build a strong brand online.

I was SO excited about the possibility of working online but I was really struggling with the lack of honest, authentic, and high-quality information out there for beginners. So before I even began working in this world, I knew one day I'd want to create the kind of high-quality resources for aspiring marketers that I felt were missing in this space.Why my coursesMy online skills have led to working with an exciting range of talented people, from sole traders to multi-million dollar businesses. And in addition to working as a freelancer, I've also worked in a digital marketing agency and an in-house corporate role. With this wide range of hands-on experiences, I am now able to teach impactful marketing courses designed with other creative overachievers in mind. So you can feel confident that my courses are made by someone who knows exactly how intimidating it can be to be trying to master 20 tools at once and stay on top of constant updates with each of them. And I hope to take away some of the overwhelm and make you feel like you're not alone in this.Why I love what I do:I'm originally from Slovakia, spent 10 years living in Canada, lived out of a backpack for a few years while working as a tour guide in Europe and have now been living in Australia since 2015. And my dream was always to be able to not be attached to physical office space and I'm so happy to say that becoming a freelancer has allowed me to continue my happy nomadic life and take my work with me to amazing places like Bali, Thailand, Cambodia and others.But since becoming a mom in 2023, my vision of 'freedom' looks a little less like laptops on a beach and a lot more like just getting to spend more time on the things (and people) that matter the most. (Though to be honest, we flew with my son three times before he was seven months old, so travel is still a huge part of my life.)Where you come in:Now, my ultimate goal is to continuously keep improving as an instructor, empowering you to be excited about your future in the digital world, having learned valuable new skills within this exciting world of online marketing. :)I couldn't live the life I live and do what I love to do every day without you, so from the bottom of my heart thank you for being here and giving me your valuable time - I can't wait to see you in my courses!Hiện thêmẨn bớt",71%,20%,7%,1%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 2/2024,1.759.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing kỹ thuật số,Phễu bán hàng,6 phần,70 bài giảng,12 giờ 11 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/profitable-sales-funnel-mastery/

I teach them the skills to create a captivating online presence without frustration, tech overwhelm or breaking the bank.I am a freelancer in the digital marketing space with a small client base. My journey with Google My Business (as it was then known as) started in 2016, when I built a website for a cabinetmaker. His business had been around for a couple of years, and he requested my help in marketing his business. As with most small businesses, his marketing budget was tight, so advertising was not an option. That was when I discovered Google My Business, now known as Google Business Profile.I was hooked. Being fascinated by what this free online listing service provided by Google could offer, I became obsessed with discovering more about GMB. I subscribed to newsletters and blogs from Local SEO experts, participated in webinars, watched videos, and absorbed all available information on the topic. There were no official courses available at the time, so my knowledge and experience comes from trial and error. It took a couple of months for my cabinetmaker to rank in the 3-Pack and his business has grown beyond his wildest dreams. He is inundated with calls and has had to employ staff to help him with the increased workload.Once I proved to myself and especially my client, that Google Business Profile does work, I was delighted. Since then, all the clients I have helped with optimising their profile rank in the 3-Pack.I decided to become a Local SEO Course Instructor after talking to many local business owners who can't afford to advertise or an SEO consultant to enhance their online presence. From my experience, I know that any business owner can optimise their Google Business Profile themselves. All it takes is motivation and the willingness to set time aside to do so. In other words, going the extra mile and in so doing they can feature on the first page of local search as it is lonely on the extra mile as so few business owners have taken the time to do so.In my first course, Rank in the Google 3-Pack and Dominate Local Search Results, I walk you through all the steps to success.My introductory course, ""Dominating Local Search with Google's 3-Pack,"" will teach you all the steps you need to succeed in boosting your online presence. While I wouldn't claim to be an expert myself, I have learned from numerous local SEO experts from around the world, which has resulted in the development of my own method to optimise Google Business Profiles for optimal results.Whilst I primarily created this course for local business owners, it is also a very good course for those who would like to earn an online income providing GBP Management Service to local businesses.

In 2008 I set up my own Graphic Design Company, Synapse Creative Design Ltd. which is still going strong, creating designs, branding and corporate IDs for our client base, ranging from startups to multi nationals and blue chip clients.   Over time as interest grew from my customer base for website design and build - in particular e-commerce - I began to realise the serious issue of educating people on what to expect with regards creating and maintaining e-commerce websites.   	                    There are many tools out there that make creating an e-store very easy, but none that can help with the most important elements of any e-store, the products.     	                    And it's this side that many clients were underestimating in terms of time-scales, legal and logistical requirements.     	                    So each time I received a request for such a store i'd lay out exactly what was required, everything the client had to consider right down to product descriptions and photography (in themselves, both massive guzzlers of cash and time). This affected the way my clients thought in terms of investment and resources and having expanded my search online I realised that many people were affected the same way.     	                    Lots of entrepreneurs and self-starters are hitting the same problems over and over. The majority of these issues come from companies and individuals who sell e-store and other solutions, but offered no advice or support for products or legal & technical requirements. At this moment I realised it was all about managing expectations, educating people to understand and assess the hidden pitfalls before they committed themselves to a course of action that would lead them to a dead end.   I embarked on trying to find easy solutions that would work for beginners as well as those who have tried and hit walls and red tape. I've created solutions that totally eliminate the need for virtually all of the issues that stop people from getting a foothold in the web design market and provide sound advice and work-throughs for the remaining issues.     	                    So I've set about creating courses that help people get a foot into web design and building and all areas that support and compliment this field. These courses provide simple yet effective solutions that get you actively involved in creating and managing your own websites without having to worry about the huge technical and logistical issues.   I always strive to make my courses as easy as possible, so that you can start quickly implementing strategies that yield professional results and yet are easy to achieve.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",59%,25%,11%,1%,4%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 1/2018,449.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing liên kết,Marketing liên kết với Amazon,9 phần,60 bài giảng,8 giờ 39 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/amazon-affiliates-easily-create-your-own-amazon-estores-now/

Today, KC gets to do what he enjoys most, which is training – bringing his years of experiences and expertise to teach business owners and individuals on how to create their own websites and marketing them online.  	  	      Over the years, KC found that most people actually do not have much difficulty learning a new tool (say using WordPress to create a website). The real problem was that people often find themselves stuck or see no results because they simply had no idea what to use those newly acquired tools for! This motivated KC to put even more focus on helping people to bridge this gap.  	  	      KC believes that everyone has something so valuable in them that other people would want to learn from. The challenge is most people do not have a system to package and sell their knowledge.

In 2010, I had a vision. Newly certified as a nutritional therapy practitioner, I wanted to build an online community full of people who were just as passionate about health and wellness as I was. What started as a simple idea morphed into the development of a large Facebook following. This resulted in my becoming an influencer in my industry. 
For nearly eight years I worked as an influencer full-time. Every day, I would wake up and post articles, recipes, videos, and graphics that were designed to help people live authentically healthy lives. My content was so well received that I began receiving notoriety throughout my industry and in the media. My work was published in various magazines, newspapers, and websites all around the world. I hosted numerous wellness workshops in the United States and even traveled to the Philippines for a two-week speaking tour! I worked with many large companies, helping to promote their products while developing content for their brands as well.   So, why did I stop?
About two years ago, I felt a calling to do more with my life. I loved that I was making a difference as a social media influencer, but I wanted to do more. Can you relate to that feeling? It’s a common experience that all influencers get from time to time! We have a calling that pulls us in a direction to help others! I had learned so much about being an influencer that I wanted to share this knowledge and experience with others. As a result, I started working one-on-one with clients who were either existing influencers or who were just getting started. I find this work incredibly rewarding as I know that I am still making a difference, not only in the lives of my clients, but in their followers’ lives as well. Let me help you flourish as an influencer!
Nothing brings me more happiness than helping others share their passion on social media. It doesn't matter what industry you are in, my unique coaching program can help you excel as an influencer. I focus on helping my clients influence from a place of creativity, compassion, and of course content. Anybody can become an influencer, but the key to success is to do it with integrity and passion.

With a PhD in marketing from The Wharton School and nearly 15 years of consulting and running my own small business, I customize the marketing strategies and tactics that I teach to MBA students for the small business owner.     	  Small business owners have been my clients for nearly 15 years in my role as co-founder of PagePoint Web Solutions and now as founder of MarketingU. I am thrilled when I can help a client clarify their marketing objectives and, more importantly, achieve them.      	        I have always loved to learn – even as a quite tiny 4-year old US Army brat stationed with my family in England in the middle of the academic year.  I told the intimidating headmaster at the local school that I wanted to start school– “tomorrow!” (much to my mother’s surprise!)     	                      This love of learning (and later teaching) has re-appeared throughout my life.  After college, I did the corporate routine for a bit but also went to school in the evenings to earn my MBA.    After finishing the MBA,  I realized that I still wanted more – and got a PhD!    While I’m done with my own formal education, I never stop being engaged in learning, teaching and coaching.     	                      I have been passionate about marketing since I started taking MBA level marketing classes in the early 90s.  I went on to earn a Master’s of Marketing and a PhD in marketing (both from the Wharton School of Business).  I brought my passion to both the MBA classroom (with gigs at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, The Wharton School’s San Francisco location and Mills College) and the world of small businesses beginning in the late 90s.     	                      As the owner of two small businesses,  I have had to learn a wide range of techniques, like you, to be more effective in my marketing.  This includes using the Internet including Google Adwords, CraigsList, and Social Media Marketing, but it also includes, referral marketing & networking from leaders like BNI (Business Network International).   All of these techniques are more effective if you have a strategy in mind that you are pursuing instead of trying out the flavor of the month.     	                      MarketingU is based on the idea that small business owners can learn about marketing strategy and tactics and execute these efforts to grow their business with just a little extra help and nudge to get them to their goals faster and more effectively.

It was a pretty normal life, except that I grew up fat. I mean, at the age of 14 my weight had already tipped the scales at 300 pounds. Sure, I built up a tolerance for people giving me hell and learned that I always had to work that much harder to be that much better than my competition, but being picked last for teams in high school and never having any girls want to be more than a friend was never fun. I can still remember my first glimpse at technology. It was 1987 and my mom had just bought me an Apple computer. Immediately I was hooked. It was an escape from life. I could play video games, pretend to be someone else, and even write a few programs while I was at it. Over the years I learned more and more about computers but didn’t know exactly what I could do with my passion. In 1995, I had already graduated from high school and was busy selling appliances at Sears. One day, a woman strolled into the store and started talking. I figured she was there for a washer and dryer. Instead, she came to offer me a job at her Internet Service Provider (ISP) company and a dollar more an hour than I was making. She heard I was good with computers and wanted to know if I’d be a part of the team. I was sold. I headed to my new job and learned how to manage servers, develop security systems and write websites. It was a true learning experience. However, after a couple of years I left the job and headed back to school. I was convinced a real degree was what I needed. Or was it? While still in college, I founded my first business making Macintosh gaming sites. Instead of taking finals, I was fielding calls from companies who wanted to use their marketing dollars to advertise directly on my sites. Who knew I could make sites I loved and make money? It was great! Then the dotcom crash came along, I spent every last dime to pay web hosting bills, and to the real world I headed working for different banks and big corporations. It never ended well and I was fired from every job. At the age of 28, I found myself overweight (about 420 lbs.), $50k in debt, smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, and sleeping on my friend’s couch. I was in a real mess, but part of me said this was all I should expect from life. And I was okay with that! Then I met J, a beautiful woman working her butt off to become an anesthesiologist. She had an insane work ethic, sent herself to school, and showed me that you can get whatever you want if you are willing to work for it. (She also became my wife.) That was the turning point. In 2003, I took the plunge and started my own business, began writing my blog (ShoeMoney.com), and took my ringtone community company, Next Pimp, to the next level. Not only had I lost over 200 pounds that year through a remarkable surgery, but I also started making more money online in one month than I had made throughout my ten-year career. Actually, a photo of me with a check for $130,000 (my one-month earnings from Google AdSense) is one of the most linked to pages on my blog. In March 2007, my business partner, David Dellanave, and I launched AuctionAds, an eBay affiliate marketing service that serves eBay auction ads on contextually relevant sites. The service won multiple awards and, in a matter of months, marketing company Media Whiz purchased a majority of the company. My blog, ShoeMoney.com, shares my ups and downs in the world of online marketing to a loyal daily readership of over 30,000 people. ShoeMoney.com has been named the Best Affiliate Marketing Blog and ranks in Technorati’s top 50 blogs for the past three years. Having made millions of dollars over the past five years, I want to share my insights with others so they, too, can learn and grow. Currently, I’m the founder of ShoeMoney Media Group as well as a husband, father (two gorgeous little girls), marketer, entrepreneur, blogger, author, and a fan of Mixed Martial Arts. Philosophy And Business Model  Embrace new trends and look for opportunities to exploit them. For example, SMG entered the ring tone market early, captured traffic and has monetized it. Finding angles and exploiting them for profit is a key aspect of SMG. Maximum and diverse revenue streams are built on fairly narrow marketing concepts that are then diversified. This is what Jeremy Schoemaker calls “the Coke Theory.” If you are already making Coke, then you can make Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, etc and turn a profit on those as well. A company can achieve growth through small degrees of separation between sites, maximizing diversity within a small industry. Focus on what you know. From the beginning of SMG, Schoemaker focused on the aspects of marketing that were second nature to him. He built his sites on those natural marketing principles while running the back end. Web design was a secondary skill, so he focused on the marketing of the sites, which then built revenue. Later he would invest in a professionally done design. Schoemaker continues to focus on existing sites and expand their income potential by building a network of sites centered on a central theme. Again, the “Coke Theory.” Small changes can equal big revenue. Once a base of traffic and revenue is built, don’t be afraid to experiment with the site. Once the traffic is there, small changes in design and structure can make big changes in revenue. Ad placement, recurring subscriptions and affiliate marketing can add value to a site without disrupting the base of revenue. Monitor revenue daily, even hourly, to see how your changes have affected revenue. If it’s not working, you can always go back to the way it was.

Originating from a background in financial services I went to work with a national motoring Association and led the development of their online business enabling the sale of financial services and membership products online. At the successful completion of that project I moved to a national energy utility and once again helped to set up their online business laying the foundation for the sale and servicing of their complete product line to their customer base in the United Kingdom.Major corporates are not the ideal environment to implement and exploit the rapidly developing opportunities which arise online so the natural next step for me was to set up my own Internet marketing business which I continue to run to this day. The goal of this business is to work with smaller and local businesses to help them be more successful online. I like to partner with local businesses giving them access to my knowledge relating to the very latest online marketing techniques and helping them increase their profits and acquire additional customers.

Hailoch Ltd4,7 xếp hạng giảng viên88 đánh giá880 học viên2 khóa họcHi, I'm Charles Palmer. Thanks for checking out my course.I am a self-published author of two collections of dark fairy tales and five other books in the genre. I have been involved in education all my adult life so I'm very happy to be an instructor on Udemy. This is what guides me as an educationalist.The best interest of students always comes first.This straightforward principle has guided me from the moment I first stepped into a classroom as a young English and History teacher in a large girls’ secondary school in south London, through promotion to head of department, head of faculty, assistant head teacher, and CEO of Clarity, the education company I founded.Clarity Education worked with gifted, talented and able students in more than forty London schools and provided consultancy services to raise educational achievement.I refer to this principle whenever I am confronted by an educational dilemma or a clash of interests. It drives me to strive for quality in all that I do within education.To return to my writing. I was brought up in Edinburgh and my family is from the Scottish Highlands. One day, I returned home from school and my grandmother asked me about my day. I told her we were learning about very bad people called the Vikings. My grandmother was not pleased with my description. For the first time in my life, two authority figures were saying things that contradicted each other.Perhaps this is the reason that, many years later, at the School of Scottish Studies in the University of Edinburgh, I wrote my dissertation on The Impact of the Viking Invasion of Orkney in the 10th Century for my Masters degree. I wanted to resolve the contradiction. One way or another it ignited my passion for the fantasy genre and I am currently working on an epic fantasy trilogy.I'm really looking forward to helping you on your writing journey. I’m totally committed to supporting you.

His unique methods and strategies have taught numerous people how to make money online, with many of his protégés posting their results publicly.  
   	      But life wasn’t always so great for Paul. Not that long ago, Paul lived in his brother’s garage. He drove his 1993 Nissan Maxima to work as a part-time cashier job at Walmart, where his wages barely covered food and gas. Life could have been better, far better, and he knew it.  	      Paul’s strong passion for music kept life interesting – he played guitar in his band, occasionally contributing keyboard and vocals too. In these days, he spent much of his free time promoting his band online to build up a following. One day while browsing the web, he came across a make money online (MMO) ad.   	      He felt skeptical, but also curious. By this time, Paul had developed considerable computing skills and knowledge and it made sense to him that he could make money online given his strong background in computing. He bought the product.   	      Today, he believes it was destiny, because he certainly wasn’t looking for what he found.  	      It said that to make money online, he should build several small blog websites in different niches, rank them in search engines, and then monetize them with Google Adsense ads. He followed this advice and to his surprise, it started to work – he was making money! Next, he expanded his business footprint by pushing CPA offers through MySpace and marketing for local business owners, helping them rank their businesses in Google (using the same skills he had acquired from ranking his own blogs).  	      He continued down this path, learning and expanding every day, and before long, business was booming.   	      Just years after living in his brother’s garage, driving his ’93 Nissan Maxima clunker to Walmart, and hoping for something more, Paul had gained something much better – freedom. Paul bought his first home and retired the Nissan Maxima in favor of a nicer, more reliable Mercedes-Benz SUV.   	      Today, Paul has no boss, and works from home on his own schedule. He is grateful to have stumbled upon the ad that eventually enabled him to live life on his own terms. And of course, some things never change – he still loves to play music and write songs.

These are the professional practitioners who are adding to their already learned skills and are now focused on improving their product development and leadership abilities. While doing that on a nightly basis, Ed works with his own Management Consulting practice in giving back to a new corporate culture by day. Ed’s focus in both Corporate Canada and Academia is to help I.T. practitioners and their organizations increase Software Development success rates by refining/redefining their software/product development processes.For organizations not able to transform into an “Agile” way of thinking quickly, Ed works with them and evaluates, recommends, and implements techniques that strategically allow them to shift to an Agile culture in a more subtle way that fits into their highly structured and constrained cultures. Whether implemented quickly or done more slowly, change is essential if we are to grow and succeed in the complex business arena of today.Ed loves interacting with his audiences when he is sharing his knowledge and his understanding of the “Agile Space.” His in-depth knowledge gives him the experiences to share that many times override “textbook theory.” Real-life always trumps theory.

I grew up feeling worthless and alone. A raft of addictions masked my pain. I was totally dysfunctional. My body and emotions were riddled with so much suffering that life seemed futile and death a welcoming option.For many years I travelled the globe, desperate to overcome and escape the chronic pain, fatigue, addictions and illnesses that resulted from years of abuse. The unrelenting pain led me to seek alternative therapy only because traditional doctors said I would have to live with the pain for the rest of my life – an extreme prophecy that I wasn’t about to accept!” Marisa tried many different therapies and studied more than 60 courses. $310,000 later she discovered her healing gift.

I am a health expert - a natural health Nutritionist and author of The Alkaline 5 Diet. I worked in medical research and the fitness industry for years prior to setting up my own business. Having built a website subscriber base of over 20,000 people to my newsletter and free recipe book at Alkaline  Diet Health Tips, this allowed me to get a major publishing deal and  reach hundreds of thousands of people around the world with the benefits  of a more alkaline (plant-based, mineral-rich) diet.          [Side note:  If you are a foodie  and love to eat then this is the perfect diet for  you, as you get to  eat big portions of delicious food and still lose  weight and get lean.  This is because it turns off your fat genes. Yes,  we have fat genes and  this is a well-researched but little-known scientific fact.]  I went from overweight smoker in my early 20s as a student to fit  ultra-marathon runner  in my late-30s - in fact, I've run over 50  endurance races in the past 15 years, injury-free - this diet really  works.If you're struggling to lose weight and keep it off, have low energy 
or niggling health issues you want to heal, do check out my diet and

Government agencies trusted me to create four startup pre-acceleration programs.I’m regularly invited as a speaker, mentor, or judge to events like The Brain Race, Product-Led Summit, LOGIN, Grand Founders Day, and multiple other startup competitions and hackathons. I work hands-on with startups, investors, and startup ecosystems as a marketing advisor.I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and a Master’s in Marketing Management with over 16 years of experience in the field. I helped implement winning marketing strategies for more than 50 businesses in different industries during my consulting practice.But there was a time when I had more doubts than answers. Long ago, I’ve tried to launch a medical tourism platform and failed miserably. I’ve burned all my savings, wasted tons of time with developers, and built nothing valuable. After two years of trying, I’ve made a hard decision to close the project. OUCH! That was a tipping point when I turned 100% into startup marketing. I became obsessed with an idea to find out how to build a successful startup.A few years later, I did a global research surveying 1,447 startup founders and running close to 500 in-depth interviews on developing a startup business successfully. Based on the findings, I’ve published the book ‘Startup Evolution Curve.’ It was highly rated by more than 30 international experts, including CEOs of startup ecosystems, serial entrepreneurs, angel, and VC investors. My book was featured on FORBES and became one of Amazon's top 5 best-selling books in startup and business innovation categories.I’ve personally gone through the process I’m teaching in this course. Using the same methodology, I’ve got more than 14.000 people signed up and waiting for my book release.

I'm an entrepreneur and I love to teach and inspire others.
I was described as a digital native recently. I smiled, and then I nodded. It’s not a phrase I like particularly, but it’s accurate. I’m your classic 'millennial', and the Digital World is all I’ve ever known.
It’s little wonder then that the social media landscape feels like ‘home soil’. It’s what I’ve always known. I’ve watched as relative unknowns have created incredible businesses off the back of an effective social media strategy. 
I run a social media agency by day and I specialise in Facebook advertising. The results my clients get are literally life changing.
Why am I on Udemy? Although I'm new to Udemy, I want to create courses that inspire people to take action. To take the strategies I teach and apply them to their business, because I know they work and I know they'll generate results. 
I want to help you and your business grow. That's the bottom line.

For me Asia and its perks always fascinated me since I can remember. I remember watching Bruce Lee & Chinese movies as a kid and was hooked right away. My professional career started in 1998 when I worked for Austria's biggest DIY retailer (bauMax). I moved to Hong Kong in 2005 when I was offered a position as an intern to work for one of the biggest Sourcing Offices in Hong Kong with a staff over 200 people. For more than 10 years I worked with the biggest retailers in the world on developing, sourcing and finding new products for them. These retailers included: Metro, Rewe, OBI, Carrefour, Tesco, WalMart, Amazon, Auchan, Lowes, Sears, Homedepot and many others. As you can imagine the big retailers expect their products to be more than just conform to standards and regulations when they purchase them in Asia. They need to be at the highest standard and quality. These retailers cannot afford to have a product re-call due to quality problems or defective components. These products need to be top-notch.In those 10 years I got to know all the standards and product requirements there are and additionally gained a lot of experience and insight working with factories in China. Not just that. I learned a lot about China, its culture & manufacturing. Where & how to find the best suppliers, how to negotiate and communicate with them, how to arrange business travel for my Customers and a lot more. In the busiest seasons (April & October), I was accompanying up to 30 Buyers within a month to exhibitions, factories and showrooms to help negotiate, develop products and follow up the Buyer's requests after they were gone. I got to know all the tips & tricks you need to return home from your trip successfully. I now have an Import/Export company based in Hong Kong that you can find under my links.I also speak publicly at large events within Asia, Europe and North America. You can also find my content on podcasts, e-interviews and magazines. I run a blog that discusses everyday business, eCommerce and importing from China. Feel free to head over to my educational site mentioned in my profile. I also have several courses here on Udemy discussing import from China, selling on Amazon and other eCommerce channels as well as certification and compliance to national standards and laws. Feel free to message me if you have any questions. All the best,Manuel BecvarHiện thêmẨn bớt",72%,21%,0%,7%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 7/2022,429.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing liên kết,Marketing liên kết,1 phần,66 bài giảng,9 giờ 7 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-start-an-affiliate-website-from-scratch-in-2021/

For Ray, it’s a persistent pursuit of knowledge, improvement, and possibility. It’s taking new, creative approaches to problems that have been previously “unsolvable” and solving them. It’s providing a wealth of knowledge to people who need it most, for them to take the next step in building their business. It’s coaching individuals who feel as though they’re stuck in a rut, confined to their current status, rather than their possibility for greatness.You’ve heard the saying “Jack of all trades, master of none”. Well, Ray has found that diversifying his experiences, becoming a “Ray of all trades”, has actually been crucial to becoming a master of some. Excelling in the fields of marketing, management, operations, public speaking, podcasting, event management and many more, Ray is not one to let an old saying determine his ability to perform and to triumph.“No one cares how much you know ‘til they know how much you care.”Nothing rings truer than this statement to Ray. As someone who has helped many businesses and individuals reclaim their purpose and get back in the game, none of his approaches would be as effective if Ray wasn’t entirely as invested in their pursuits as the business owners or individuals themselves. His caring, protective nature drives him to help wherever he possibly can.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",89%,0%,11%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 9/2023,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing kỹ thuật số,Xuất bản podcast,2 phần,9 bài giảng,10 giờ 2 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/launching-your-podcast-in-7-days-using-the-6ps-framework/

Basically, i was buying traffic from Fiverr and reselling on my own website.This was the starting point of my e-commerce journey.Then, i decided to not always be on the ""buyers"" side of Fiverr, so i created my own gig selling the only type of skill i had - video editing.It took time to get successful on Fiverr, but, eventually I figured everything out and started making real money from selling my skills.Then, I got interested in selling on Amazon. Selling with fulfillment by amazon to be accurate. It took me several month to learn everything, find a good product to sell and rank it in the amazon search results. I lost some money, i made mistakes, but, eventually i figured everything out and started making good income.Then, i got interested in Dropshipping, so I created a Woocommerce website and started selling the most popular products on the market.

Ed has a passion to help and lead the transforming of I.T. communities from the traditional failing development cultures of the past to the successes achieved from a philosophy of “Agile Thinking.”As a multifaceted public speaker, presenter, educator and corporate mentor in a number of diverse arena’s, bridging the generations from the Y/Millennials to the Gen X’ers right up to the Boomers, Ed’s passion is to see success and excellence again become part of what we have lost in our current organizational cultures.Ed trains professionals in the University environment on a nightly basis. These are the professional practitioners who are adding to their already learned skills and are now focused on improving their product development and leadership abilities. While doing that on a nightly basis, Ed works with his own Management Consulting practice in giving back to a new corporate culture by day. Ed’s focus in both Corporate Canada and Academia is to help I.T. practitioners and their organizations increase Software Development success rates by refining/redefining their software/product development processes.For organizations not able to transform into an “Agile” way of thinking quickly, Ed works with them and evaluates, recommends, and implements techniques that strategically allow them to shift to an Agile culture in a more subtle way that fits into their highly structured and constrained cultures. Whether implemented quickly or done more slowly, change is essential if we are to grow and succeed in the complex business arena of today.Ed loves interacting with his audiences when he is sharing his knowledge and his understanding of the “Agile Space.” His in-depth knowledge gives him the experiences to share that many times override “textbook theory.” Real-life always trumps theory.

He attended UCLA college and majored in Computer Information Systems and Business Marketing. Kent worked as an Account Executive at an Investment Banking firm from 2006-2009. Bored with his career choice, in late 2009 he went back to school and took a crash course in Graphic Design and Computer Programming. In April 2010, he launched his first website at Read2Learn which encourages people to read books to learn new skills.He tries to read at least one book per week. He used to be one of those people who would never pick up a book because he thought they were boring. 
Everything changed when he discovered ""How To.."" books on Amazon which he finds very interesting. Now he's officially a book nerd, and he's always learning something new.Based on his experience, he's believes that anyone can learn how to do anything if they truly have the desire to learn and succeed. With so much mis-information being passed around the internet, Kent Mauresmo teamed up with Anastasiya Petrova (another book junkie) and decided to write their own books.Kent and Ana's books are created out of frustration. Simply put, they've had to read countless blog, countless books, and have watched countless videos to find solutions to their problems.
They simplify everything that they learn from multiple sources, and then combine the most useful information in their books to help save people time.Their first book entitled,""How To Build a Website With WordPress...Fast!"" was released February 20, 2012 and became a best seller within the first 30 days.Their second book entitled,""SEO For WordPress..Beginners Guide"" was released May 30, 2012.

There is so much I wanted to do for my wife:Buy her the clothes that she lovesBuy her an amazing and reliable carTake her out to the best restaurantTravel to different countriesThe same is true for my children – I wanted to give them the best:EducationClothesFoodArea to live inHowever, the JOB that I had did not allow me to do most of these things. I was working crazy hours and I could only go on vacation when they told me to.I then decided to go online and do some research on how to start an online business. Something amazing happened to me though, I started to see ALL the potential that starting an online business had.BUT…It was not as easy as I thought it would be. I invested a lot of money to learn the necessary skills to make money online. However, when I made my first sale I saw that it actually works.There is no cap on the amount of money I can make in with an online business.I encourage people, especially parents, to start with affiliate marketing. Unlike other businesses – the product(s) or service is already there, you don’t have to create your own. I think that this is awesome.My Goal Now…My goal is to become a millionaire by the end of 2022.Moreover, by working hard and by God’s grace I will provide for my family the things that having a full-time job does not allow me to provide for them.Another strong desire I have is, once I achieve success even at a minimal level – is to educate parents about the power of starting an online business so that they too can live the life of their dreams.Part of my vision for this business is to help parents achieve the same goals I have. Family is so important and with all the stresses that come with taking care of a family, we sometimes lose sight of that.I Believe that…That working smart and hard are very important. For me starting an online business is a smart move because once you learn how to do it, you only have to work a few hours a week.It is now my responsibility to grow my business.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",25%,75%,0%,0%,0%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 10/2023,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing trên mạng xã hội,Tạo nội dung bằng trí tuệ nhân tạo,3 phần,16 bài giảng,1 giờ 37 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-social-media-marketing-with-chatgpt-ai/

Ed’s student's number in the thousands, both in the corporate arena, as well as in Post-Secondary Academia. Ed has a passion to help and lead the transforming of I.T. communities from the traditional failing development cultures of the past to the successes achieved from a philosophy of “Agile Thinking.”As a multifaceted public speaker, presenter, educator and corporate mentor in a number of diverse arena’s, bridging the generations from the Y/Millennials to the Gen X’ers right up to the Boomers, Ed’s passion is to see success and excellence again become part of what we have lost in our current organizational cultures.Ed trains professionals in the University environment on a nightly basis. These are the professional practitioners who are adding to their already learned skills and are now focused on improving their product development and leadership abilities. While doing that on a nightly basis, Ed works with his own Management Consulting practice in giving back to a new corporate culture by day. Ed’s focus in both Corporate Canada and Academia is to help I.T. practitioners and their organizations increase Software Development success rates by refining/redefining their software/product development processes.For organizations not able to transform into an “Agile” way of thinking quickly, Ed works with them and evaluates, recommends, and implements techniques that strategically allow them to shift to an Agile culture in a more subtle way that fits into their highly structured and constrained cultures. Whether implemented quickly or done more slowly, change is essential if we are to grow and succeed in the complex business arena of today.Ed loves interacting with his audiences when he is sharing his knowledge and his understanding of the “Agile Space.” His in-depth knowledge gives him the experiences to share that many times override “textbook theory.” Real-life always trumps theory. His students are in positions of leadership all over the globe. They love his teaching style, but more so, they love the understanding of Agile that they receive through his training. This gives them what they need to journey successfully on the pathway to achieving their dreams!Hiện thêmẨn bớt",67%,21%,7%,1%,4%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 4/2021,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing trên mạng xã hội,Marketing trên Facebook,4 phần,16 bài giảng,2 giờ 30 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-traffic-mastrclassfree-facebook-traffic-strategies/

I’m here to share the knowledge I gain online through my own testing and how you can stop wasting time trying different non-tested failed methods. I’m here to show you how you can DIY online and save some money for your business.The beginning is always a good place.Hello, my name is Marty Englander. I was born 15/04/1994 in Manchester, England. Since being little, I always had an eye for creative things and was always fascinated with tech.Up until the age of 9 years old, I was never allowed to go on a computer which I think sparked my interest even more. I used to sneak onto my mother’s computer when she was not around and play games etc…I was always a little impatient playing game so I quickly somehow managed to start learning to hack them… As you can imagine, the games got boring fast!I then started looking at hosting my own private server games which is where you host the game for people to play on. I LOVED this. I loved the ability to be able to create something where other people got something back.As the years went on…When I reached high school, I was one of the class clowns. I can give a number of reasons why I may have been this way, but ultimately I think it’s because I felt like I was never giving value by simply sitting in school like a zombie learning things.I always wanted to do practical things which is why I guess I thrived in subjects like Drama and Media.I realised near the end of the sixth form that I hated formal education and the only thing keeping me in education was friends. Upsettingly I knew I had to leave everything and get my act together because I was heading down a road which would not end well.Oh crap…Everything changed.I decided to leave full-time education near the end of the sixth form.I had no real qualifications. No skills. No anything. Just my thoughts were telling me this is the right decision for me.I remember my father telling me when I told him I wanted to leave “If you leave, you can lounge in the house all day, but I will not give you money”. I never wanted to lounge around the house, I left school because it felt wrong to be there and felt like it was a waste of my time, if I’m going to invest my time, I want it to be worthwhile.I guess this is where my world changed.I created my CV and started handing them out… Never got anywhere with it apart from one, the casino. They needed dealers for a 6-month poker tournament from 8 pm – 3 am.I went in, aced the interview and got a call back to go back and get some training. The day I was supposed to go in and start training, my father did not want me to do it due to the hours and other reasons, and he found me a job.The only problem was, it was a job with my grandfather.Don’t get me wrong, my grandpa is a great guy, and he has a solid business but… he’s old school and well, I’m not.My grandfather is a bag manufacturer. The idea of working for him, was I go in and learn the ropes and when he’s ready to retire, I take over. In the Englander family, we have 90+ years of bag manufacturing history, so once my grandfather stops, that’s the end of it.It did not go to plan which was a shame because it was creative and not too bad.When I was younger I used to create videos of the games I used to play.Anyway, my dad remembered this and suggested to come with him in his accountancy firm and provide video like services. He would open up a media department, and id run it so to speak.I thought “why not”.During this time I also became a member of a number of freelancing sites and started developing my skill sets again.After a few years of realising creating videos for businesses was not something I enjoyed, I then moved over to web development and online infrastructures.I became pretty good at it and thought I’d create some How to videos so other people can DIY.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",53%,29%,10%,7%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 10/2019,419.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Xây dựng thương hiệu,Email Marketing,10 phần,37 bài giảng,4 giờ 0 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/photoshop-design-into-an-html-email-signature-2019-novice/

Ed’s student's number in the thousands, both in the corporate arena, as well as in Post-Secondary Academia. Ed has a passion to help and lead the transforming of I.T. communities from the traditional failing development cultures of the past to the successes achieved from a philosophy of “Agile Thinking.”As a multifaceted public speaker, presenter, educator and corporate mentor in a number of diverse arena’s, bridging the generations from the Y/Millennials to the Gen X’ers right up to the Boomers, Ed’s passion is to see success and excellence again become part of what we have lost in our current organizational cultures.Ed trains professionals in the University environment on a nightly basis. These are the professional practitioners who are adding to their already learned skills and are now focused on improving their product development and leadership abilities. While doing that on a nightly basis, Ed works with his own Management Consulting practice in giving back to a new corporate culture by day. Ed’s focus in both Corporate Canada and Academia is to help I.T. practitioners and their organizations increase Software Development success rates by refining/redefining their software/product development processes.For organizations not able to transform into an “Agile” way of thinking quickly, Ed works with them and evaluates, recommends, and implements techniques that strategically allow them to shift to an Agile culture in a more subtle way that fits into their highly structured and constrained cultures. Whether implemented quickly or done more slowly, change is essential if we are to grow and succeed in the complex business arena of today.Ed loves interacting with his audiences when he is sharing his knowledge and his understanding of the “Agile Space.” His in-depth knowledge gives him the experiences to share that many times override “textbook theory.” Real-life always trumps theory. His students are in positions of leadership all over the globe. They love his teaching style, but more so, they love the understanding of Agile that they receive through his training. This gives them what they need to journey successfully on the pathway to achieving their dreams!Hiện thêmẨn bớt",69%,14%,15%,1%,1%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 5/2023,469.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing trên mạng xã hội,Xuất bản podcast,5 phần,63 bài giảng,5 giờ 48 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/anchor-podcasting-masterclass-say-it-with-anchor-by-spotify/

I'm an Internet Entrepreneur with a background in both the Management Consulting & Telecommunications industries. The skills that I have acquired during those stints and in previous years in general have unleashed my passion to teach.
I have a wide array of skills that I share with you via my courses
  (1) Social Media
One of my true passions, I have invested a lot of time building a presence online. Highlights include:
 Creating a connection base of 100+ people in a large Management Consulting firm within weeks of starting the job.  Met with a handful of Managing Directors & Senior Managers after approaching them on Social Media Trained Partners on how to effectively make use of LinkedIn & Twitter to network and generate leads Conducted Workshops with Project Teams and Small Enterprises on the use of Twitter and LinkedIn(2) Resume/CV & Interviewing
With 30+ Job applications, I have gained a deep understanding of the recruiting process
 I have never failed to get an interview (phone or face-to-face) after submitting my Resume Participated in over 20 Job Interviews & Assessment Centres Worked for a leading Management Consulting firm in a highly competitive market(3) Productivity
 Heavy user of Microsoft Excel & PowerPoint. I completely rebuilt the spreadsheets inherited from one of my teams, reducing the monthly updating time by over half the time (a few business days) Co-produced reports that were ultimately held by members of the Board of Directors in one of the Multinationals I worked in (using Excel & PowerPoint) General productivity freak, I love technology and always look for ways to make it work for me 
How I got here…
Until recently I never really envisioned myself starting my own business. In fact, it was quite the opposite - my dream was to work for a large Multinational/ Consulting company and enjoy the riches of the Corporate life…
I soon found myself in what I thought would be my ""dream job"" only to do work that wasn't at all fulfilling, spending hours every day commuting and paying enormous rent (almost half of my salary) in one of the largest cities in the world. I felt stuck, limited and didn't think much of my future prospects.
I look back now and find it funny how at our lowest points we make life-changing decisions. Since a few members of our Mastermind Group had launched online businesses, I decided I would give it a try. I made up my mind that whatever happened, I absolutely HAD to launch an online product before my birthday.
Within two months, I launched my first Udemy course.
One month later I decided to quit my job (to the utter amazement of my colleagues, managers, friends & family - they probably thought I was crazy) and never looked back since.
My Goal
What I aim for is simple: I want to get you real results in the fastest possible time. Whether it's improving your presence on Social Media, getting your dream job, improving your productivity or self-development, I want you to walk away from my courses with a sense of achievement.
The courses I create are structured in a step-by-step manner so that you can implement them straight away. They do require your effort & commitment, but if you do that I'm extremely confident you can get to the next level.
Ultimately, receiving a message from a satisfied student detailing how I've helped him or her is immensely gratifying, more so than any number of sales.

For over half a decade, I've been obsessed with meaningful conversations that start with a brave cold email and generous connection.But my obsession wasn't always that way. It began as a frustration. Several years ago, when I was helping fast-growing B2B companies with sales, I'd hunt for the magic “cold email” template. I found some techniques that were okay. Others worked for a while - and then they didn’t. I was in for a shocker: No ONE cold email works 100 percent of the time. I was frustrated.My frustration turned into curiosity. Curiosity turned into an obsession. Obsession turned into rigorous testing and reiterations. In the process, I have tested over one million cold emails. These tests helped us to find the techniques that worked. I've used these techniques to grow my own business and continue to help my clients connect with thousands of their dream clients.My strategies and ideas have been featured in Entrepreneur, Technology Innovation Management Review, Australia & New Zealand Marketing Academy, International Colloquium on Relationship Marketing (France), HubSpot Blog, Enterprise Sales Forum, EvanCarmichael, and Firefly Millward Brown.In my courses, I hold nothing back.

Understanding the client’s target market well enough to speak their language and win them over is a favourite too.
I had the privilege to grow up in an entrepreneurial home where my mum ran her own marketing consultancy, Purple Mookiting. What free time I had after school and in holidays was spent working in the business and I am now a full time consultant and co-member. Marketing has always been a passion as is psychology. The two disciplines complement each other and I regularly use my psychology principles in the workplace.
Social media are dynamic and rewarding. Reaching a target market is made so much easier and creating engaging posts presents an opportunity for creativity. With direct feedback from customers and prospects, it allows me to get in touch with the market and interact with them. I just love it! I do understand all the jargon and change can feel overwhelming and confusing and I enjoy sharing how to work with platforms like Facebook in a simple, easy to follow way that allows the student to use them confidently.
I love my friends, my horse and my dogs. I love music and play piano (well) and guitar (poorly). I love art and design. I love reading and am constantly searching for new books.

When it comes to mindset (and how to level up yours), I’m both student and teacher, master and novice, devoted follower and rebellious skeptic.

I call out bullshit and expect the best. I don’t give excuses and I won’t take them so if you coach with me, expect to be told the truth, directed on the path and held to VERY high standards.

And it’s the real humans that hire you and pay your fees. The humans just happen to use a search engine to find your website.SEO that focuses only on search engines – especially at the expense of your real human visitors – isn’t worth your time.So this course won’t include “secrets” that only the professionals can use, or techniques that may soon become obsolete with the next Google update; instead, this course will make SEO approachable and simple to use, even if you aren’t technically inclined.We’ll start with a good introduction to how engines actually work to catalog and deliver content to users and then cover how you can help them accurately display your content to the people looking for what you write about. The more you give the search engines what they need to do their jobs, the more traffic your content will generate.This course isn’t designed to teach you all that there is to know about SEO; exhausting that topic would take much more than an hour and a half.But if you have struggled with understanding SEO on your own, the SEO for Bloggers and Other Content Creators Course will help you to master the basics of SEO so more of the people you write your content for will be able to find it.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",31%,33%,24%,7%,5%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 1/2021,399.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,SEO,Marketing kỹ thuật số,4 phần,18 bài giảng,1 giờ 51 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-seo-tutorial-for-the-beginners/

Bored with his career choice, in late 2009 he went back to school and took a crash course in Graphic Design and Computer Programming. In April 2010, he launched his first website at Read2Learn which encourages people to read books to learn new skills.He tries to read at least one book per week.

Everything changed when he discovered ""How To.."" books on Amazon which he finds very interesting. Now he's officially a book nerd, and he's always learning something new.Based on his experience, he's believes that anyone can learn how to do anything if they truly have the desire to learn and succeed. With so much mis-information being passed around the internet, Kent Mauresmo teamed up with Anastasiya Petrova (another book junkie) and decided to write their own books.Kent and Ana's books are created out of frustration. Simply put, they've had to read countless blog, countless books, and have watched countless videos to find solutions to their problems.
They simplify everything that they learn from multiple sources, and then combine the most useful information in their books to help save people time.Their first book entitled,""How To Build a Website With WordPress...Fast!"" was released February 20, 2012 and became a best seller within the first 30 days.Their second book entitled,""SEO For WordPress..Beginners Guide"" was released May 30, 2012.

Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by the way technology evolves to more efficiently and effectively help people get things done.
For the last 20 years of my career, I've worked with large companies to apply leading edge technology to deliver results and to help them achieve their desired business goals and outcomes.
I've been involved with every major wave of technology since the early 90's working with companies to connect to the internet for the first time, designing early web-enabled ecommerce platforms through to cloud computing and hybrid IT over the last ten years especially.
During that time, I've worked with the technology of every major platform and vendor in the public and private cloud space such as: VMWare, Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
In my spare time over the past decade, I setup and run a few of online marketing services businesses with my wife.  This area has expanded my mind and skillset into things like SEO, Copywriting and Content Marketing.  In particular, I've been able to combine these online marketing skills with my technology and management experience to help people setup and operate their own online businesses successfully.
I'm originally from Toronto, Canada but have been living in Sydney, Australia for the past 21 years with my wife and son.

He attended UCLA college and majored in Computer Information Systems and Business Marketing. Kent worked as an Account Executive at an Investment Banking firm from 2006-2009. Bored with his career choice, in late 2009 he went back to school and took a crash course in Graphic Design and Computer Programming. In April 2010, he launched his first website at Read2Learn which encourages people to read books to learn new skills.He tries to read at least one book per week. He used to be one of those people who would never pick up a book because he thought they were boring. 
Everything changed when he discovered ""How To.."" books on Amazon which he finds very interesting. Now he's officially a book nerd, and he's always learning something new.Based on his experience, he's believes that anyone can learn how to do anything if they truly have the desire to learn and succeed. With so much mis-information being passed around the internet, Kent Mauresmo teamed up with Anastasiya Petrova (another book junkie) and decided to write their own books.Kent and Ana's books are created out of frustration. Simply put, they've had to read countless blog, countless books, and have watched countless videos to find solutions to their problems.
They simplify everything that they learn from multiple sources, and then combine the most useful information in their books to help save people time.Their first book entitled,""How To Build a Website With WordPress...Fast!"" was released February 20, 2012 and became a best seller within the first 30 days.Their second book entitled,""SEO For WordPress..Beginners Guide"" was released May 30, 2012.

My name is Andrzej Pach (but Andrew is easier to say ^^) and I spend my daily time with graphic design, presentations, motion & animation, typography, video editing, and online teaching. Most of my work is done in Adobe After Effects & Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 / 2021 / 365 and Camtasia so naturally, this is the software I want to teach about and share my experience with. I have completed more than 5000 graphic projects for clients, mostly including video animations like intros, outros, and transitions for various YouTube channels & marketers. On Fiverr alone (a freelancing website), I have more than 3500 reviews and 4k+ finished jobs. I would like to share with you the knowledge that I was able to ""stack up"" during the process. I am always willing to help people out by enhancing their brands and projects.    	Who am I?  I'm born in 1989, live in a small village in Poland, and graduated from my University in July 2014. A few years back, when I tried to find my ""place"" after getting hired to prepare a website, flyer, and business card for a local business in my area, I finally ""felt it"". Since then (2011) I have expanded my skills in this area by completing various graphic, website, and design-related projects. Places like the Warrior Forum, freelancing websites, and graphic contests across the web caught my interest and never let me go. I run my own company since April 2015.  	What is the next step?  I've gathered experience by working for several years as a freelancer with a keen focus on handling creative projects ranging from very small businesses to brands and YouTube channels with over 500k subscribers. Now I’m looking forward to sharing my knowledge by creating exciting courses that are easy to follow - and most importantly - USEFUL to you. I am looking to work with forward-thinking people who seek to create something original and catchy that will reinforce their brand and follow their vibe. I’m always committed to providing value while giving away random tips to make your workflow easier, no matter what we work on.    	What are my mission and passion? I believe in making the Web Business and Internet Media world a better place because my actions will affect (and hopefully positively shape) my followers, friends, family, and future generations. Since I live in a small village where people work in agriculture or do physical labor, I set the goal for myself to be a sort of pioneer in the web-based business field, growing myself as a designer every single day.    You can always contact me, as I don't mind talking to anyone about how I might help your business or about what course topics I might record if you like my teaching style.       To your success, Andrew (Andrzej in Polish) ;)Hiện thêmẨn bớt",51%,36%,11%,0%,2%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 4/2025,439.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing qua nội dung,InVideo,12 phần,37 bài giảng,1 giờ 33 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/invideo-ai-video-creation-course/

Ed has a passion to help and lead the transforming of I.T. communities from the traditional failing development cultures of the past to the successes achieved from a philosophy of “Agile Thinking.”As a multifaceted public speaker, presenter, educator and corporate mentor in a number of diverse arena’s, bridging the generations from the Y/Millennials to the Gen X’ers right up to the Boomers, Ed’s passion is to see success and excellence again become part of what we have lost in our current organizational cultures.Ed trains professionals in the University environment on a nightly basis. These are the professional practitioners who are adding to their already learned skills and are now focused on improving their product development and leadership abilities. While doing that on a nightly basis, Ed works with his own Management Consulting practice in giving back to a new corporate culture by day. Ed’s focus in both Corporate Canada and Academia is to help I.T. practitioners and their organizations increase Software Development success rates by refining/redefining their software/product development processes.For organizations not able to transform into an “Agile” way of thinking quickly, Ed works with them and evaluates, recommends, and implements techniques that strategically allow them to shift to an Agile culture in a more subtle way that fits into their highly structured and constrained cultures. Whether implemented quickly or done more slowly, change is essential if we are to grow and succeed in the complex business arena of today.Ed loves interacting with his audiences when he is sharing his knowledge and his understanding of the “Agile Space.” His in-depth knowledge gives him the experiences to share that many times override “textbook theory.” Real-life always trumps theory.

That’s why during the years I was pretty much obsessed with all kinds of technologies related to marketing and sales. Digital marketing was also taking a special place in my marketing/tech passions blend. I have a Masters's Degree in Marketing which has helped me grow my business portfolio while my tech background is related mainly to web development which I started in my high school years.I was a Head of Marketing in a big global company where I was leading a dedicated operational team. I had the chance to explore the possibilities of any kind of technology that can improve the marketing processes.Then I decided to start my own hustle, so I used my web developing skills and managed to build an innovative printing and digital marketing platform, unique for the EU markets. Then I continued with developing an e-commerce store and my own accessories brand. For both of these projects, I managed to implement different kinds of marketing automation systems driven by AI technology.During my journey, I realized that the marketing industry is being disrupted so quickly that it’s really hard for business owners to catch up with innovations by themselves. They needed professional guidance so, that’s how my digital agency - minds.studio - was born. However, my passions for technologies persisted and I felt it’s time for me to share my knowledge that I gained from the corporate world and side hustles. That was the time when my blog AI Sessions was born. I believe that knowledge can be more effective only if it can be applied to the right tools. Therefore, I decided to invest in several platforms which helped me to grow my own projects and definitely can help my students for their hustles as well. That’s why I’m giving away free tools for all of my course subscribers.Hiện thêmẨn bớt",29%,44%,12%,10%,5%,Lần cập nhật gần đây nhất 6/2021,419.000 ₫,N/A,N/A,Marketing,Marketing kỹ thuật số,Artificial Intelligence (AI),9 phần,36 bài giảng,2 giờ 23 phút tổng thời lượng,N/A,Tiếng Anh,https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-in-marketing/

I am incredibly passionate about pushing myself to live life to my highest potential… And that’s what I want to help YOU do as well
I want to help empower and inspire you to live your life to the fullest, create the reality you truly want for yourself and your family, and live according to your true purpose on this planet.
First, a little bit about me…
I live in Lexington, KY, in the USA. It’s a fantastic city with incredible natural beauty, history and it’s often voted the friendliest city in America. As they say here, “beautiful places & smiling faces.” Growing up I lived in a number of different places. I even lived in Germany for a few years. Great Country, great times….just a bit cold. I have traveled extensively and for me, Lexington is the best place to call home.
I have been in the Internet Marketing industry my entire adult life. Although I have worked very hard, I have also been very blessed and very fortunate. Over the years, I have helped hundreds of individuals create an income online. It’s very rewarding for me to be able to help people that have a desire to succeed, create above average incomes. I have built several great relationships over the years with people....and I really love it. 
Like many people, I struggled a great deal at first when I started Internet Marketing. I had no idea what I was doing nor did I have a “go to” person who could mentor me and help me out. Yep…I was lost in the vast sea of the internet and spent tons of money and more time than I care to admit, trying to get it all figured out.
Long story short…I did finally find a mentor who showed me the way. I went from never having made a cent online…to a six figure online income in only a matter of months. It’s amazing what happens when you know what to do and implement it correctly.
I am a huge believer in Multiple Streams of Income. Marketing online truly opens up the entire world to you and I plan to do this forever.
It pains me to see so many people struggle and struggle to get this whole “internet thing” figured out. Over the years I have connected with some of the best online marketers and through those associations, I have learned a great deal. I know that the more you succeed, the more I succeed. Zig Ziglar said it best, “If you help enough other people get what they want, you will get everything you want.” 
Let’s Create Together…
Let’s grow together and become the true artists on this canvas called life.

To Your Success,
Lance Locke

In the beginning of my career, I worked as a tech support rep for an international company based in Mykolaiv (South of Ukraine). Then I decided to fly solo and launched my own online business which is WebDesy for the most part now. I'm really into traveling. So, you can see me traveling elsewhere than at home. Thing is, people need help with WordPress SEO all around the world. :)I personally know lots of people who ask the same question again and again. There are lots of search engine experts out there but there's no one-stop resource that takes you from zero to hero by offering a video how-to tutorial on everything related to SEO (also known as inbound marketing). However small or seemingly unimportant it may look for SEO gurus.That being said, I decided to take the plunge and fix the situation myself. Back in the day (like a year ago), I created a WordPress SEO that allowed my students to take care of WordPress when it comes to on-page or technical SEO.Over time people started asking if I consider creating a course that helps with actual link building. And that's exactly why I created my last course available on Udemy as well.The link building course offers you easy-to-follow video tutorials on how to do link building on high domain authority sites, such as Web 2.0 properties, etc. If you're about to tell me that it won't work anymore, hold your horses. It won't work if you do it the spammy way.In case you actually take the time and efforts to make your accounts and content on those platforms look and work as they are supposed to, rest assured that it will work for you.

My name is Dennis and I'm an entrepreneur. <-- Probably one of many things we have in common. Not that your name is Dennis, I mean that you're probably an entrepreneur too. I have experienced many fails and successes in my journey. I'll start with my failures. I once paid a marketing agency over $18,000 per year to handle all my marketing for one of my companies. Another fail was when I tried to launch 3 businesses right after high school and all of which failed for the same reason.That reason? Is the #1 reason why I've been able to scale 2 very successful businesses that I currently am apart of. The reason the first businesses failed was because I lacked having a system. Meaning I started a few businesses just chasing more money. I didn't focus on building relationships and solving problems. I just wanted more money. And the lack of a system resulted in a failed business.However, I chose not to cry in the corner and think poor me. I invested in some world class trainings from some of the best entrepreneurs on the planet. Russell Brunson, Anik Singal and Aaron Fletcher to name a few. And since then, I've truly transformed my entire ""mentality"" of how business is done. And the truth is, it's pretty simple. The end result as an entrepreneur is always to grow a business without sacrificing more time to do so. However, you can't generate sales without leads. Even further, you can't generate leads without site traffic. Aka marketing. Marketing can take your business anywhere you want it to go. And a few of my courses will teach you how to do just that. I have confidence that you're closer than you think to becoming an entrepreneur sensation.

You need to know that you're in a good hand that can deliver the promise before investing your time and money with me.  So I'll keep it short and humble. My name is Huthayfa Nawafleh, a Jordanian in his 30s living in Abu Dhabi since 2012.  When I decided to finally quit the 9-5 life, ditch my rewarding senior level job, and start my own business in the summer of 2014, I thought I had what takes to be successful.  Little did I know that I was leaving my job to create another one. But this time was different... less rewarding, tough, consuming, stressful, and seems to be impossible.  There are moments in life forcing people to change and I had mine. When I had to quit, I found myself unemployable due to the situation I dug myself into.  So I had to find a way to make things work again.... there were no other options! I realized that SALES is the ONE and the ONLY thing I need to focus on if I ever wanted to save myself.  The problem was that I didn't have a team, couldn't afford hiring talents, couldn't pay for marketing agencies, and didn't have much time before everything collapses over my head and breaks my life for good.... I didn't know what to do or where to start from.  I had to find a solution to get more customers and consistent sales so that I get back to live a normal life.  Long story short...I took full responsibility to learn online marketing and take care of business growth myself and I discovered a way to do it without paying for anything that doesn't get me at least 3 times more than what I spend.  That discovery has changed my life and here I am today.

After that, I was hooked.Later I taught Realtors at Keller Williams about productivity, marketing, business budgeting, organization, goal setting and more. A few years later I joined Coldwell-Banker and began teaching social media, blogging, WordPress, SEO, and marketing. I also consulted with their Top Producing Real Estate Agent and the company's Broker.In 2007, I started another company revolving around online marketing.
